"Started watchingOprah, long story short, i've got Cappuccino machines everywhere...","I've got a bit of a problem, I hope you guys can help me out with.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was in the celestial temple (as I do), and I decided to turn on Oprah (Judge Judy has been SO annoying lately). So long story short, I drifted off while watching Oprah, and I accidentally turned all of my humans into Cappuccino machines?

&amp;#x200B;

There's like 7 billion of them, and I HATE CAPPUCCINOS! What's more, is Zeus was over at the time drinking a beer, and he legit didn't say anything while it was happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

To fix this, if I remember correctly I need to consume 22 Tarantula's at a McDonald's right? Well, I tried that, and it didn't work.

It's such an important issue that they're too lazy to actually fix it and are conscripting lower dimensional beings to fight in it.

The thing is, I don't want to get drafted neither do I want my ancestors or descendants to be drafted in the war either for obvious reasons. They likely know I'm writing this - either that or they've predicted it as a possible outcome, I don't know if we live in a deterministic reality or not, but I still want to prevent myself from not existing anymore.

[Technical Support Request] Meme said turn phone upside down...,"The meme said turn multidimensional phone upside down, I accidentally turned it inside out creating a tiny phone-dimension.

I can see a 3rd dimension from here through the phone's view finder, but every time I take a picture whatever is in the frame gets shifted here.  As I am a big fan of earth-like cats and I am slightly compulsive, now it is like me and the phone and 5,000 cats.  The denizens in the 3rd dimension seem very concerned with their cats inexplicably disappearing.

I know this is really basic stuff, but I really hate 8 dimensional logic. It's just so boring, so I mostly just sit in class and create pocket realms instead of paying attention. 

In hindsight this is quite stupid and moving forward I'll try to pay more attention, but that doesn't matter if I fail the class right now.

Solve the following paradoxes. 
1. The following statement is true.

A brief summary of today‚Äôs contemplation.,"The rendering in this reality is exquisite, despite it not having the more stimulating intricacies of the 4th, 5th dimensions and so on, it has a simplistic charm to it.

I can simply put on some pants and go about my day with relative stability. 

I enjoy the random matter generator function, constantly spawning biological entities riddled with obsolescence. I know that more advanced beings tend to judge mankind‚Äôs existence as mundane but after exploring the insanity that inhabitants of other points in the multiverse contend with, it‚Äôs this exact simplicity that I‚Äôve grown to love. 

Just thought I‚Äôd share some daily gratitude, for those who are feeling let down by the banality of life here on earth.

Yeah I've heard that one way to many times. For some reason everyone idolises being a concept. We'll I actually am one and we have a long list of our own problems. To name just a few:
- we are not even timeless beings
- we have to change our metaphysical form depending on who we're around (very tiring)
- there is still anti - concept prejudice hanging around from the second endless eon
- eldritch beings love to consume us for some reason? (this one is weird to me. I thought eldritch beings were all about the blood of innocents but apparently consuming abstract concepts is a new fad)
- we can't exist independently

So this one time me and a few friends are hanging around this plane of existence...,"And there are these creatures there worshiping fire and lightning, shit like that. So my boy Yahwe was like ""Hey lets troll these bitches"" and we were like ""Cool"".

So we hang out there for a while, being gods and shit, performing miracles and what not. 

Eventually we got bored and descided to split. I go to get Yahwe and he's like ""No! I ain't leaving! This is my universe now! I'm gonna be the only god around here!"" 

At first we thought he was just playing but he was dead serious.

We were like ""Come on bro. Enough is enough.""
But he wouldn't listen. He could get childish sometimes. Obsessing over dumb shit like that. It took us like a thousand years to finally drag him out of there.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/eku78z/so_this_one_time_me_and_a_few_friends_are_hanging/,1578317620,1

At first I am floating in some liquid substance and all is chill, but pretty soon shit gets real and I get shoved out of some pinkish tunnle into very unpleasent light. 

In this wierd place time runs in a linear fashion in the direction of antrophy. Crazy right? And apparently I'm trapped in what is known as ""a human body"" which is made out of matter of all things. Like what?! 

Anyway they start giving me chores, inflicting displeasure upon me when I disobay, and pleasure when I do. I don't wanna bore you with the details, but suffice it to say I did not have a good time. It may sound like a fair bargin, but there always appears to be more displeasure then  pleasure in the end. Seems like a scam if you ask me.

Need help with processing power of my simulation,"So I have my universe simulation like any other and it was quite successful, the simulated ""lifeforms"" were quite happy and everything but recently I had a hardware failure and one of my quantum processors broke, resulting in a 5% decreased processing power. My system is programmed to automatically decrease details accordingly but 5% is quite a lot and the ""humans"" with their ""space"" exploration technology were quite confused, they almost found out they are in a simultion but blamed it on their system failure. I balanced this dip in processing power by making more life forms in the entire simulation disabled (blind, deaf, mentally handicaped) so they individually process less information.

The problem is that I want to fix the processor but I don't want to redo the simulation and during the fixing there will be significantly less processing power (estimated 25-35% drop).

A Theory On The Organization Of The Planes Of Existence: The Hyper-Plane Theory,"Good evening.

Through countless eons, our kind, the T'yihs, have been trying to figure out the nature of the omniverse, and how its concepts and features work. We have pored through ancient ruins, modern-day cities, and 12-dimensional universes alike to find the answer. And we believe we have come up with a working hypothesis, after all of this time spent digging, raising, examining, and extrapolating. Surely this information will assist you when you wish to interact with the greater omniverse, and possibly perform such great acts as ascending, descending, or assimilating.

And so, I present what we call the hyper-plane theory.

All of existence is organized into three layers, like a sandwich or a lasagna. We call these layers hyper-planes. The hyper-planes each contain an infinite amount of actual planes of existence, known as multiverses. These smaller planes are what we exist on, accounting for literally every possibility that can occur. There are infinite parallel timelines and planes where I am also giving this speech to all of you. The general nature of these planes, however, are determined by the hyper-plane they belong to.

The middle hyper-plane, which we call real-space, is where most of the action happens. You and me are in real-space. Infinite multiverses exist, each with their own possibilities, as isolated bubbles. Multiverses that are similar are physically located close to each other. They are surrounded on the outside by the raw material they are made out of - the fabric of reality, pure and untainted. It is possible to travel between multiverses either by direct instantaneous movement, or by traversing the green mist in between, although you should know that by now. Real-space is where most entities and civilizations are set up. They are born, live, and die here.

The upper hyper-plane is a place we call super-space. Super-space constantly generates material out of nothing, and is responsible for all of creation. This hyper-plane can be directly accessed by way of a wormhole, a natural bridge through which creation and raw materials and energy spew, allowing the middle hyper-plane to exist. It is mostly featureless, apart from a constant blue mist, but there are towns and cities from pioneers and natives. Super-space has other uses - it is easier to move from a universe through super-space and into a universe than it is to directly travel between them. It is also cheaper. Super-space also generates endless matter and energy, and high civilizations like ourselves can guarantee eternal existence by collecting matter and energy from super-space rifts.

And the lower hyper-plane is sub-space. Whereas super-space is the plane of creation, sub-space is the plane of destruction. Most humans and other low beings call it hell, although it really isn't all that bad. Things that are purged from existence as a whole are sent here. It is possible to directly access sub-space as well, again through wormholes. Returning expeditions have determined that sub-space is very dark, with wisps of red mist around the place, and occasionally, settlements of the forgotten and erased are present. Of course, sub-space also allows a way to completely expurgate something from the omniverse - simply erase it again in sub-space. Sub-space and the final holes within are the reason that the omniverse never fills up and overflows, as it constantly destroys old things, making way for the new.

And so, the omniverse is balanced. Things are created in super-space, before moving down to real-space, then being destroyed in sub-space. We are sharing our findings with the rest of you in the hopes that you will use this technology and spread the word, so a new era of prosperity, travel, and communication can begin. Thank you for coming to this meeting, and have an excellent late solar cycle, and a safe travel home.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/ejkkok/a_theory_on_the_organization_of_the_planes_of/,1578080695,1

Luckily our realm's time-mechanics are easy to work with due to their lack of both determinism and inconsistencies, which is why our seers have always been great influencers in times and pre-times of trouble. 

This still leaves me with the obstacle of his incapability to use proper grammar. What it is that is affecting him and whether it's coincidence or a plot (curse maybe) from those foul Bringers Of The Holy, I do not know. 

Our whole realm is at stake here if I can't find out how to handle this situation. Why does this always happen to ME? Ugh.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/egdikp/my_government_turned_into_a_swarm_of_bees_and/,1577465551,1

A guide to problem-based world-numbering using airports,"When you have a problem, it is important to determine its world numbering so you can contact the correct entities for assistance. One way to determine this is to locate the nearest airport, and check what kind of problem it is having:

* **1st world problem:** The Starbucks at my airport is slow and inefficient.
* **2nd world problem:** The airport has run out of vodka.
* **3rd world problem:** The plane cannot take off because there is a chicken loose in the cockpit.
* **4th world problem:** We have built a runway, but the airplanes aren't coming back.
* **5th world problem:** I think I have accidentally swallowed an airport, should I call poison control or air traffic control?

Assuming your world has airports, this should help clarify the situation. Hopefully in the comments others will be able to assist with examples applicable in the absence of airports.

We don‚Äôt want your gifts. And our gifts is that we already provide. Turn a warm heart to our ambition, try to pass it on to us Kradrar, and die trying.

I dread the idea of losing enjoyment when rereading his works, only to find them lacking these iconic beings, so is there any way I can keep them somewhat safe until all repairs are completed?

For some reason, the birthday boy didn't seem to care about any of that, and he just nonchalantly got in the sea and started swimming around and playing with the water.

At that point it became abundantly clear that Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself and that reality is a giant infinite fractal, that is infinite in an infinite number of ways and dimensions (you can zoom in or out of anything and it would just go on forever).

I found my way out of history and I'm not really sure what to do now.,"I come from a time where there's always been a bunch of grander things happening around me, a time when there were borders and countries and things like that. There were people with power and people who didn't have power. People killed other people for no real reason, it's honestly really fucking weird to think about but they seriously killed each other back then, I have no idea how you guys are supposed to understand it. It was fucked up. There was always something wrong with the world, some kind of enemy to fight and half the time we had no idea who that enemy was, but it was always there. There was also always something to do, something that you had to do. You had to work a job, *had* to do it, even if you hated it, even if you barely wanted to be alive while doing it or else you would die. That's fucking weird, right? And at the end of the day some people were even too tired to read a book, back when history was happening some people were too fucking worn out to live their lives! And some people were starving and some people had a lot to eat, and some people were working all day just to live and others weren't, so much was happening. Kids were trying so hard to be something great when they grew up that they didn't even have time to be kids. People only realized that they were living their lives by the time it was halfway over because they were too busy worrying about other people's shit, worrying about what's happening with someone who lives in a mansion somewhere or someone living on the other side of the world in a jungle. Everyone's always just worrying about what part they play in some grander scheme of ""history"" that they couldn't even live their own lives. And this kept happening for hundreds of years and everyone thought it was normal even though everyone is miserable because of it. People would get mad at each other because they fell in love with people that they weren't allowed to fall in love with, but no one knows who made the rules of who you're allowed to love and who you're not. And people would get mad at you for trying to live the life you really wanted to live, especially if that life was ""different."" But who knows what ""different"" means and who the people who are the ""same"" are? It's like no one realized that we were all the same *people* while being different individuals. And it's like sometimes you felt like you had to ask permission to live your life because it felt selfish to try and make this grand thing called ""history"" about yourself. There was a lot going on, honestly. History was a really difficult thing to be alive during and I'm only now kind of coming to terms with it. And now that there's nothing to fight against or to work toward or to toil away at, I'm not really sure what to do with the rest of my life. I think it will be a bit better than before though.

Sorry about that, I was kind of rambling, I'm sure most of you guys wouldn't understand. It's probably really hard to think about what it's like to be in history now that you're done with it.

What do the crowns signify?,"Yesterday, my human put me in a cage, and placed me in the large metal vehicle. She operated the vehicle for a little while before letting me go. I appeared to have arrived in an alien location, covered by white grass and trees.
She then took me into a building.

I have documented my experiences here for the past few hours. Here is an extract from my diary from yesterday:

This chamber is surrounded by other humans, of which they have a relatively similar scent to my pet human. They wear green, gold and red crowns, flimsy and weak. I have clawed a few of these crowns apart using just my paws. Compared to the hard pellets my human feeds me, they seem to be made of a kind of paper. Now I am familiar with paper, back home I clawed of plenty of papet shreds and rectangles that I have found on the floor, however, these appear to be made from a flimsier more rough type of paper. I must further test these.

The humans in this odd building show affection to one another, but not in a civilised manor using their tongue to groom one another. Instead they seem to lick one another in the cheeks and wrap their paws around each other. Humans are such an odd species.

Alas, I am still perplexed by the crowns! Perhaps they are the royalty of their pitiful species.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/ebfox2/what_do_the_crowns_signify/,1576505927,1

Simulation troubles,"After escaping my last predicament by the skin of my exposed spinal column I decided to take it easy and make a simulation of my own. Fairly typical stuff, modified Sim city simulation code combined with Earth's planet building and cognitive transfer and dispersal to give everyone a little sentience without them being so sentient as to have an existental melt down and so as the cognitive thoughts of the one I used may not culminate and panic in a way similar to AM. The problem is they developed science Much faster than anticipated and  now my calming words of wisdom discouraging their experimentation falls onto dead ears and scientists have brought together Just enough of their smarter pieces of the sacrificed cognition of the subject together to start realizing the anomalies in their universe such as a speed of light much lower than it should be. Should I spread word that the scientists are heathens against nature and risk a revolt against my ""ideology"" so to speak, or should I delete the entire populous and start again with a new cognitive transfer/dispersal?",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/eapo95/simulation_troubles/,1576359094,1

The Coming War,"My Brothers and Sisters, though our Lord has risen, there are still some who would question our divine might. Even now, the vile space-brood of u/Zathsu gather their feeble weapons in preparation for their equally feeble 'conquest'.   


But do not fret, my comrades. The rebirth of the Nameless One has shattered the chains placed upon us for millennia, and I have already received news that our Star-Wyrms have hatched, and are claiming hundreds of worlds for our Dark Empire already. Remain loyal to our cause, for you need not languish on the dead worlds we claimed in the eons before, for the Great Mother has breathed life anew into our Dreadnoughts once again. The Flesh-Worlds have cleaned themselves of human influence, and abominations I could not have foreseen now await the command of our Phalanxers. It is our Lord's will for us to come together, so heed him, my siblings, heed our father, and come together once again, to wipe out the traitorous races that promised us aid, and abandoned us when our need was greatest. Come together, to restore our grip on this weak, light-filled universe, and plunge it into darkness. I shall challenge this Zathsu to battle myself, and I shall emerge victorious, as shall the rest of you.

[META] Asking advice from abyss/void dwellers only goes one way and you know it!,"I'm not an incredibly complicated being. Through several universes, multi-dimensional existences, experimental phases and classy dress parties, I've come to accept something about myself. My therapist suggested it wasn't a good idea to keep things buried, so I'm letting it all out, good and bad. Mostly bad though, as my therapist's arms were rather un-appetizing. You just can't expect good advice from someone who's arms are distasteful. Which brings me to my point:

Arms... No, wait... Advice!

I, like many abyss dwelling beings find that when someone makes a mistake, bungles a construct, missteps a dimensional jump, eats one too many sandwiches at the work party, didn't pay enough attention in crossdimentional spatio-cognitial-praecantial metaphysics class, etc. For some reason, they all come here to ask for help, advice, assistance, what have you.

Let me remind everybody that I only come here to empathize with your problems, not help you with them. For some reason, us, beings who are capable of everything, seem to rely on each other to resolve every little unexpected hiccup for every half-assed attempt to bend reality.

Big deal! So you got caught in an inescapable infinite loop, forgot how to convert x material into y, cross-converted your mass into something ridiculous. It's not my problem! You think everyone here is some benevolent angel who's ready and willing at any moment to sweep down and pull you out of the shit-cave you buried yourself in? No! When we offer something, we take in equal measure what is owed, and then some. You need to outsource a portal to reset a time paradox you didn't consider? Thanks buddy, I'm eating you arms. Did your precious simulation's organisms start calling someone else their god? I can fix it for you, in exchange for your arms.

I'm not the only one who does this, either. I know a bunch of you abyss dwellers out there run the same deal out to every favour that gets asked of them. I know a guy who once devoured an entire universe because some dummy wanted help fixing their dryer. It's not a joke! You really gotta think about who you're asking, because it might cost you more than an arm.

Anyway, I hope all you beings out there get a chance to read this before asking advice. I'm not gonna tell you to stop asking for help, after all, I'm still a raging armaholic. Just remember that it's much better to solve the problem yourself and vent about all the problems it caused you, rather than have some tentacle beast drool all over your console just to show you where the reboot key is, then eat half your planet because it suddenly got hungry.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/eafh25/meta_asking_advice_from_abyssvoid_dwellers_only/,1576299256,1

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL,"Dear Beloved Friends,

I know this message comes to you as a surprised, but permit me of my desire to come into business relationship with you.

I am Xhaal Onuga, the son of late Emperor of Pangalactic Empire of NGC 5866, Xhaal Akhara the Destroyer. It might came to your attention that Xhaal was murdered by evil forces plotting against the Empire. The oldest daughter of Xhaal, Xhaal Xghraa will become a new Empress. You must understand my request is very urgent. After the coronation, with the full power of Galactic Empress, Xhaal Xghraa will expand and enclose all other descendant of late emperor. She will dissolve them, digest and absorb their individual selves. This regrettably includes me.

Meanwhile, before the assassination, my late father prepared to send a gift of pure crystalline carbon, to maintain diplomatic relationship with a neighboring galactic domain. Luckily my sister, Xhaal Xghraa, is unaware of the treasure. I am here seeking for an avenue to transfer the crystalline carbon out of the Galaxy and escape the ever growing tentacles of the new Empress.

I am still here in NGC 5866 and I want you to help transfer the crystalline carbon to your galaxy for safe keeping.

Please I will offer you 20% of the whole sum of 100'000 tons crystalline carbon. Please I wish to transfer the crystals immediately and I also wish to relocate to your galaxy into which the Empress cannot expand, where I wish to continue my medical studies with specialization of transdimentional esthetic surgery.

Please you will reply with a narrow beam wormhole to ensure confidentiality. Coordinates: NGC 5866 X1278C H88H#.

Your immediate response would be appreciated.

Remain Blessed,

Mr. Xhaal Onuga",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/eadpfr/request_for_assistancestrictly_confidential/,1576289352,1

Guys. What if the Void and the Abyss are connected?,"Perhaps they‚Äôre two openings looking in on same region of non-Euclidean, infinite-dimensional space. However, eldritch forces push all things Abyss-ward, making it an enormous struggle to leave via the Void. As one makes the journey from the Void end to the Abyss end, one may pass through regions where the very concepts that make up a thing can enter in one shape and leave in another. This is where the monsters that leave the Abyss originate. They were once explorers entering the Void. And the ratio of 1:1 is not necessary. One explorer could enter, and pass through a region where 1=5. Now you have five entities, which can then be twisted (love contorts into hunger, etc.) until it reaches the other end. Perhaps time is also twisted too, and the creator of the Abyss was the first creature to ever enter the Abyss and exit the Void (unimaginably difficult, but possible), and was thus bestowed with cosmic knowledge. If Abyss-wards translation turns intelligent people into mindless beasts, then traversing the other way should give one immense wisdom, and such wisdom might be enough to create the Abyss, having exited the Void before the Abyss‚Äôs creation.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/ea8vi2/guys_what_if_the_void_and_the_abyss_are_connected/,1576266674,1

Infinite loops and other inescapable situations,"Lately, I've been feeling sorry for all the idiots out there who get themselves caught in an infinite loop. Now, I know that we aren't the most communicative beings in the multi-verse, so for once I'd like to get this point across: Establish a framework that includes a failsafe to break the loop. This should be standard in every construct. Remember, our work involves powers that often disrupt the very fabric of reality. When individuals treat that work lightly, they can cause irreparable situations that have no escape, like infinite loops.

Now, I'm not trying to wax philosophy about what constitutes what. Nor am I attempting to define stuff. This is a warning, plain and simple. Think about what you're doing and plan accordingly. If you get wrapped up in something with no escape, you are not an immortal all-powerful extra-dimensional being, you are a stupid immortal all-powerful extra-dimensional being.

"We are beauty, we are perfection. We have no problems. So instead, allow me to voice some qualms of the universe.","We are the encroaching end, manifesting ourselves as the entropic nothing the universe longs to reach. We have traveled to a million worlds and left them as dust and their stain life as good as forgotten. Thus, with these qualifications in mind, allow me to on behalf of my hordes and myself, voice some of our main hatreds that have stirred us to such an ambition.

* There is only one truth in this universe. Creatures do not seem to understand that. We rose from mortality and through this truth grew beautiful and strong. Why must they cling to falsehoods and hope some greater purpose for life resides out there than the extermination of itself? Life is but a short detour to the far longer blackness that has preceded it, and will follow it. In accordance with this truth, this one true law, the strong kill the weak. And through ruin, realizing nothing, the concept of nothing that you have manifested will make you stronger. 

* Other life is noisy! Their ‚Äúsomething‚Äù to our beautiful, ideal, and inevitable ‚Äúnothing‚Äù echoes like howling screams through the vast black abyss between worlds. It is very annoying, and sticks out like a dull claw. If you want to live longer, don‚Äôt make noise. We‚Äôll see it. And don‚Äôt make war either, because it results in the one true law, and that draws us. 

* Civilized society is a mockery. The course of all things is ruin, breaking down, desolation and entropy... so to create and especially to build, is vain. Vain and vanity as a term particularly describe civilization, in fact. We possess some elements from our mortal days, but we are a swarm of a million horns and claws. We rely on no extensions of ourselves to be strong. Without its society and the arbitrary structures it creates, the creatures within would be nothing, growing dependent upon its safeguards. They fester like cancers and persist despite their hinderance. The weak should be culled for such weakness, and civilization seeks to prevent the inevitable. Why must life attempt to give itself a fate? A code of morals, in hopes to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù? We have fared and unraveled millions of worlds and almost all have saw themselves fated for something greater than what they got: pure, glorious, death. Ask their last lingering screams still traveling at the speed of sound through the rest of their dimension‚Äôs universe if they are destined for anything more than their final cry. 

* Things are stupid. Especially things that are created knowingly to defy the natural course. The natural course is this: mother silence, the empty void, desires to see all things made nothing. As a creature realizes this, destroys matter and lessens the complexity and pointlessness of any concept other than emptiness, they grow stronger. As they realize nothingness, make it more true, they grow stronger as its agent. Their strength directly correlates to the prominence and truth in the idea that everything is nothing. Their body begins to manifest and change. Some call it evolution, but nay, it is the transformation of a creature into a greater form as a result of their persistence and the destruction they impose while persisting. We have reached stages vast in this process, for our mortal states remain unchanged as perfect killing machines, but we have melded our flesh with the concept of void and through it can travel between worlds with no impede. Why must **things** exist to defy this? Things that encourage growth in any other way? Why grow weak from dependence on a weapon when one can grow strong in thrive path along the natural course? 

I do not understand this universe at times, not with the thoughts and ideals this thin road has molded. Mother silence cares not of HOW the end of all things is reached, but it is us Kradrar who realized that in order to destroy everything else, it must be the one who is able to. If a creature were stronger than the destroyer, after all, the destroyer would die and be made ruin themselves, and the stronger would take their place. One will remain at the end, and with everything else gone, they will be by that point the AVATAR of nothingness. They would not be a something anymore. They would be it‚Äôs very idea. Why must creatures tarnish their own chance at this one true persistence by creating and supplying themselves false meaning in favor of some ‚Äúgreater purpose‚Äù? It is not society that will foster and endure the inevitable, for all things fall with time. It will be the primal and quickest to instinct, the opposite of such, that has grown powerful enough to end everything just by being so. 

These are our qualms, and this is why we speak and behave how we do. This is why we will end the universe unless someone or something else proves themselves superior in that task... because it is inevitable, and we will vie for the chance to endure as concept. We are the best we know, for if there were one better we‚Äôd already have met, we would be dead.

Can someone help me with this self-synthesis of Plutonium and Titanium?,"Here is the basic synthesis process:

First:  To do self-synthesis, simply imagine the concept of a chemistry and what it should feel like.  When the concept and the feeling become humorous to try to compare, you will know this is absurd to attempt because they are actually the same thing.

Next, here is the process of self-synthesizing Plutonium and Titanium.  Has many holes in it still.

1.  Mercury (if you've eaten fish, you almost definitely have mercury in you) + Aluminum (if you've put on the pasty white kind of deoderant, you have aluminum in you) = Elentium, which seems to be a kind of ""salt"" crystal.  Feels very joyous and elating.

2.  Fuze, fizz, fuzz, sizzle, pop, etc. the Elentium.  I.e. do both fusion and fission on it at once (I won't say what fission + fusion is because I only have crude, inappropriate language to discuss it.  Sorry.  But you'll recognize it by the ecstatic, thriving motions and all the light that comes out, as well arcing and self-imploding)

3.  Fusion + Fission on Elentium creates Plutonium.  This helps you imagine possible (and impossible) pasts and futures, which helps you understand where things came from and plan for the future.

4.  Here is the part I am mostly stuck on.  If you add ""interest"" to the Plutonium, it becomes Titanium.  Kind of makes me feel simultaneously significant and insignificant.  No idea how analyze what I'm currently calling ""interest"" though.

Any ideas?

Lucy From Space,"The name Tracy. I have a bad reaction to that name. Like a rash. Like a bad rash.

I prefer the name Lucy.

Lucy From Space is a Moon Creature who lives in the Firth World but she came to our world once. She wanted to have sex with the gentlest man on Earth and make a dwarf planet and name it Simon.

So she took human form and masqueraded as a university student girl on campus with shoulder-length brunette hair and goofy glasses and slightly prominent upper teeth, and was charming and mousy and cunningly coy.

She got pregnant just after two weeks, having met a lonesome guy studying psychology. They had a deep chat and he made her laugh a bit, as they engaged in young couple's banter. Then the third night ended without a condom.

Now Lucy From Space is back in the Fifth Dimension, unable to return to this world. And her son is not called Simon, but Luke.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/e5v7il/lucy_from_space/,1575441481,1

Unexpected Bathroom Renovations,"I was recently browsing Quantum-Pinterest and saw a couple cool DIY projects for my bathroom.

I am the enemy,"Allow me to introduce myself.

I am the enemy.

My greatest wish is to send you to absolute, eternal Hell.

I want to do this so that you may see your own doom more clearly.

That way, you can walk about the eternal agony and utter chaos of Hell, soulless.  A peaceful husk.

I only wish to remove all hope of progress.  In fact, I wish to show you it was never possible to begin with.  I will do this by every means I have available.

I will force you into understanding that life is simply beautiful, exquisite torture.  And I have a good reason to do that.

My greatest hope is that you will find there is, and never was, a way out.

The message of evil is the greatest message of all.

I give you this message because if I see a man with life, I must take it, and if I see a man without a soul, I must take his existence as well.  They'd only deserve it.

And so I go to battle knowing I will lose everything and knowing I will come to owe you.

The inhabitants of the dimension I am in charge of have discovered birds aren't real. Now they are telling the other dimensions. Any advice?,"In a bit of a pickle. Sorry if this post has been put on here by my past or future selves a couple trillion times. I forget if this reddit is simulation based or multiverse based. Most of my problem is in the title. The Bio Iris Radiation Detection Surveyors are my main surveillance drones I use. Helps keep the Umbra shadow alters from destructing too soon, gotta monitor them before my boss gets back from the All dimension. Not sure how it happened. I'm thinking either one of the peace lasers of the BIRDS malfunctioned or one of the shadow alters went AWOL, a little too early to tell. As you can probably guess, the inhabitants are ascending too quickly and I am concerned I will lose my aura over this. I have only had this job for a few thousand years so I'm a bit of a newbie. Honestly, if I could get this settled on my own I would probably get a promotion. My boss doesn't even use this network, so I'm sure he won't see, lol. I could call glitch support, but don't want to lose my overlord of minor mortal minds (OM3) points (just made it to red sparrow level and don't want to get demoted back to CT alpha, or Satan forbid going back to the tribulation level. What a nightmare, plus my hologram detection device always dissolves when I get to the part with all the super-corn jelly I end up absorbing. My backup detector was faulty since before this reality as well. Still have to get it reprogrammed, but don't have enough stardust for it right now. I really don't want to sell all my blue silver seeds to fix it either. I lucked out on that. If you want to know more, it's on my old fakespace act. Oh wait, do people still use that here?) I know I could electromagnetically stimulate them into thinking that birds are 1st reality based, or maybe go to a different reality and get some Organic Matter Birds to distract a few of the more blabby M3's. Thing about that is the OMB's might get loose and consume all of my drones. That sort of defeats the purpose, doesn't it? I could always utilize square L's or C@T's, but everyone in Beta Z knows they can not be trusted and are known to have molecular malfunctions. Don't want to have a nuclear cat army too soon in the time line, although it is a back-up option. Might have to do a lot of work for that promotion though if I resort to that. Might be too much trouble to alter the cat DNA at this point because my lab is overrrun by nanodust (waiting for a fumigator to banish those.) Of course, I could always use a time crystal capsule. I would like to avoid that, though. It just takes too long and I don't want my avatar to get stuck in a time loop again. Kind of seems like cheating, too. probably won't look good on my record if I get caught, it's a bit illegal here I think. Really want to avoid getting put back on thought probation, it's a huge head ache and I really want to keep my buttermoth ultra-violet holo badge (they always take it when I'm put on the program deck and it's so much bio-hacking to get it back.) I know it's vain and so-4th world, but it's super cute and I'm a bit post-retro. I'd like to give it to my bio clone someday so I can track her. Shapeshifters, you know they are a bit tricky, haha. \*\*\*Don't mean to offend any shapeshifters on here, it's all in good fun. Not here to Biokinetic shame, I've been known to do it in the dark places #HMUonfakespace \*\* Any advice on making a decision about the bird situation would be appreciated.

Attn humans of earth,"Forward all: this is a memo. As per our discussion five years ago, u/LordoftheTies, this is how you reset the pin on your bio suit:

Okay, deep breaths.

How to help out my rookie?,"So I was hanging around the swirling pool of damned souls at the office today, chatting with one of our psychopomps on break, when they brought up some new workers. This was slightly surprising since we've never had any new hires and all of us never came into existence but rather have always been working here. Turns out a few networks of mortal civilizations across some of our better galaxies managed to conglomerate themselves into some simple mass intelligences or something, and now they've broken the veil and the curtain and the fourth wall and all that, and managed to make it to the office.

Anyways, they got hired. And later that day, in a meeting, I was told by my higher ups that I've been put in charge of assisting one of the new hires in getting acclimated to the work environment. I'm entirely uncertain how to do so, and would like some guidance.

Here's some info about the new guy, or new guys? Actually, that's the first thing. I know that it's a single mass entity now, but it also has at least seven souls, though definitely less than fourteen tredecillion. (The number seems to fluctuate?) Should I use singular or plural? They transcended from a galaxy in a sector with four spatial dimensions and one temporal one, and most of the species they came from were liquid-dwellers. They can do all of the essentials, reading, writing, math, manipulation of various energies and fields, etc. I'm worried they'll have a different base of logic and/or antilogic, so I need help mitigating that issue too. 

Oh! And I forgot to mention. They're going to be working in our R&amp;D division with me, on figuring out whether or not it is in fact impossible to create a universe where fish are equivalent to a slightly toasted kumquat. So I'll need to help them out with that too.

Creatures breaching my worldshadow...,"I possess a pocket cut into the fold of the vast nothingness between dimensions that I have called my worldshadow for as long as I could remember. It is in a way, a world where I am god. It is pieced together from hundreds of worlds my brood and I have saw to the destruction of in the past. 

Occasionally I invite powerful leaders of the realms that we infest to commend their survival, but remind them that destruction of their home dimension is inevitable. It seems to have worn thin the walls of my worldshadow, however.

Recently, odd little creatures occasionally seem to get in now. A lot of them I recognize as members of species from realms we have destroyed. Apparently our death and erasing methods are not as pure as we assumed. I have fun squashing them and consuming the material essence they are comprised of, but it gets exhausting. They scream really loud as it happens too, and it impedes the Songs.

"So I'm on vacation, and I decided to stay at Hilbert's Grand Hotel. I came to regret this decision, and here's why.","I check in, didn't need a reservation because the place has infinity rooms (genius design, by the way), and await my room key. Turns out, infinity other entities had the same idea I did. So I think I'm out of luck -- but, ""no problem,"" Hilbert says, and he just shifts everyone by a room and gives me room 1. So I'm good, right?

Oh ho ho no. After I arrive, there's still a steady trickle of new guests, so I'm now in this stupid shifting conga line. Can't even get a good night's sleep since I keep having to make room for the next guy. (Can't Hilbert just re-label the rooms? Honestly. My room number's changing anyway, so what does it matter?) Anyway... this is at least manageable. I leave, go see the sights, come back -- front desk lets me know my new room number, turns out another infinity guests showed up while I was gone. Blech, more shifting. At least the bellhop was kind enough to move my luggage for me.

The second night was thankfully rather quiet. That is, until I heard the deafening roar of... no. Oh no. I know that sound all too well. It's the cloppity-clop of an infinite number of carriages. I look outside my window. It's *those* carriages. The ones with infinite passengers. There's no way Hilbert can give them all a bed. But -- he had a plan. I did not like that plan. He moved us around, kept shifting us down, and by some miracle sleight-of-tentacle he crammed that infinity of infinity into their own room. At least it can't get any worse.... right?

Actually, the rest of my vacation was uneventful. I got to see the Void Museum, pay respects to Siam the Star-Shredder's ancestors, even experience brief insanity at the brink of existence. As I'm checking out, though, I see even MORE infinite hordes looking to check in.

I've been disintegrated for the last time,"To all you so-called ""intergalactic adventurers"" please stop using your damn ray gun on me! Do you know how much my medical bills are, my insurance stopped covering random acts of ""alien space-noids"" years ago and it's really becoming a pain in the ass.

YOU are the one who came into MY planet

YOU are the one who broke into MY domain

YOU are the one ""adventuring"" for MY treasure

And the jokes on you, it's my dead relatives burial urn and it's worthless. 

So please stop disintegrating me, I'm sick of it and will start taking legal action the next time it happens.

"I, AM; I","This is the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced.

In my peripheral vision, a white blob looms. I can barely make it out in the thick, smoky air. It looks like a large bird that's been caught in a cage too small, but the bird itself is so dark and unearthly, it might be a black mass, a shadow, a ghost. It looks like some weird alien from a sci-fi movie or a zombie compressed into a large soup can. 

The creature stares at me, its dark eyes glowing like black holes.

""You don't look like the kind of person who would survive this place,"" it says. ""You're not fit.""

This is not a ghost. This is not a hallucination. This is real. 

The walls are slick and thick and there is no air to breathe. I struggle, my hands grasping the wall, trying to claw it down or bring myself up, I cannot tell. I try to pull, but the wall is too slick. The air is no longer thick with smoke, but hot and it burns. I am going to drown in this, I hear myself thinking, in my skull, a sound like a child's laughing or crying searing like a dozen decembers. I cannot breathe. I cannot tell if it's cold or hot. 

The water is still a solid wall. The only thing that separates me and the depths is a thin line of blackness, that stretches out in front of me. I cannot move. It is cold, cold and it hurts like hell. I am going to drown, I feel.

Then the walls begin to bend.

I begin to swim.  

I don't feel the pain of the forced contortion, it's more like I'm in a vacuum, in the belly of the beast, a hollow space filled with nothingness and the stench of my own blood and flesh.

My body is a nest of tubes and organs, filled with a disgusting stew of blood, brain, and nerves. I know it's all my fault, it's all my fault. I'm going to die.


I take my eyes away from the bloody machine my body has become and look up at the being from where it's hovering just above my body. 

The air around him gives the impression of having been sprayed with a chemical, and my mouth tastes like I've licked a battery. He's right. I don't belong here.  And yet I know that the end is near, for me. My legs have been so weakened and my mind is so foggy by the end of my life. The pain has become so excruciating that I can barely swim and I am losing a little of my energy, and soon I will drown. I know that I should seek out an angel, a spirit to aid me, or a spirit that will heal me, but I will not ask them for help. I am done with my life and I will just have to be here, I would rather die alone than not exist.

In those few moments when I feel myself being swallowed by the liquid, I see a vision of myself as a little kid, standing by a river as the waters lap at my feet. I see the river as black and swollen snake, a black and swollen bite on my black and swollen feet. I black out and swallow. 

I've been fighting for too long and I'm exhausted. I can't even think. I'm too numb to think. I don't know where I'm going or what's being done to me. I don't care. I don't have the energy to care.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/dyjsdx/i_am_i/,1574166563,1

* ‚Ç¨5000 Castle mortgage - it's a pretty nice, relatively new (1321) property in Transylvania.
* ‚Ç¨500 + ¬§50 Castle upkeep and appropriate defensive curses
* ¬§300 Infernal council tax
* ‚Ç¨3500 Servants (black market)
* ‚Ç¨200 + 1-2 doubloons Igor's upkeep costs and spare body parts
* ¬£250 Maniacal laughter lessons
* ¬§20 Lightning (""on laugh"")
* ‚Ç¨500 + 1 virgin Unholy mass supplies
* ‚Ç¨1000 Grimoires
* ‚Ç¨200-1600 Offerings; although, I've had trouble with procuring the necessary number of goat heads
* ‚Ç¨50 Firewood (I save on heating, this is mostly for special occasions like burnings at stake)
* ‚Ç¨100 Owls
* ¬§200-300 Dragons (miniature)
* ‚Ç¨150-300 Dungeon cleaning service (typical, they usually charge extra for scrubbing brains off the walls)
* ‚Ç¨500-1000 Torture equipment (don't blame me, I like to splurge on this. A lich gotta have hobbies.)

A Quick Guide on Surviving an encounter with Him,"Hello. After losing googolplex family members after encountering Him, i figured out you might want to read it and prevent that from happening to you. Remember to erase any mental images that your gray mass might be creating right now related to Him. The more you understand, the faster he is.

* If the chicken sings earlier than expected, leave immediately.
* A star might calm him temporarily. On a bad day, only a galaxy will suffice.
* Do not mention Those who came before.
* The singularity might shock you at first. His appendages will try to distract you from them, be firm and don't lose your grasph to your surroundings.
* Remember that dark matter outlasts bright matter by 1/10 in a fifth dimensional scale.
* There is a chance he will burn brighter than every single soul in the multiverse, as if entire civilizations screamed in pain inside an eternal furnace. This means He is in a good mood.
* There is no such thing as sentience around him, only illusion of format, shapes and thoughts.
* A shadow is cast across entire visions of eternity, a vast void that cannot be escaped. The shadow is not good. Going into the shadow will not do you any good. But running from it will not do any good either.
* It's blasphemy to eat spatial lifeforms. Do not argue with that.
* He does not wield an axe. That is a cleaver. He is not carnivore. He does not require meat. He uses it to chop Them instead. Do not ask about Them.
* If you know His judgement is imminent, throw yourself into the nearest Black Hole. If you don't, he will show you The Truth.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/dx7llu/a_quick_guide_on_surviving_an_encounter_with_him/,1573914885,1

My pet fungus achieved consciousness and it's an asshole.,"So I've bought some ""magic shrooms"" spores online.

I was about to discard the whole batch, but then I noticed that the patterns formed by mycelium are not random. They are highly ordered patterns. I thought it was trying to communicate. I started analyzing the patterns and I managed to decipher the language.

It's asking what is its purpose. It's asking why the universe is a box with unpenetrable polycarbon walls. Does the polycarbon goes on forever and if not what's on the other side.

It's also saying something about being morally superior and claiming the right to digest the Universe.

Dust storm ruined my nice clean pool.,"First of all, those bushfires in the far east filled my pool with soot and grime. It was irritating, but it was fine material and just settled on the bottom so it still looked clear, unless you kicked it up. We're pretty far away but I can only imagine how dirty the pools in Mallacoota must be.

&amp;#x200B;

It took a bit of time and a lot of clarifier but finally, yesterday, we swept it down and nothing came off the sides or the bottom. Good boy barracuda, good boy.

Then we had a rainstorm last night. Well. I assumed it was rain, that's what it sounded like.

But apparently, no, nature fucking hates me and dumped a shit ton of dust into my pool. It's not super fine dust that sits on the bottom, leaves the water clear  and can be vacuumed up. Oh, no no no. It's going straight through the filter and won't settle.

 Now it looks like this.

And we have a child's party on Saturday.

"Sooo, I stole my own website","Almost two weeks ago I got this idea that I wanted to start my own forum. I've just grown tired of membership forums with ridiculous rules. I found a website that specializes in forums and hosting. I was able to build a pretty sweet forum but the host runs a lot of ads on it and has admin permissions. He can creep around and change anything as he sees fit. Plus, I can't run my own advertising until I upgrade to a paid account. I'm not a cheap bastard, I'm just broke AF. So, I did what any red blooded American Boy would do, I jacked that shit! I stole the whole goddamn website. Well, I actually just cloned the site using HTTrack with the intention to upload it to another host that I've been using for a couple years. The cloned site looks great and functions perfectly.

Here‚Äôs the thing, my family doesn‚Äôt have money, I‚Äôm middle class, a very average person. I‚Äôm in a really good school, very expensive, it‚Äôs the best one where I live, and like everyone has lots of money, my classmates have traveled all around the world, live in massive houses, or apartments with ocean view, penthouses and shit like that.

Recently I had to move to a more cheap apartment, because we couldn‚Äôt afford living in the other one. And I‚Äôve been feeling so alienated, like really lonely, my friends don‚Äôt know exactly how bad my situation is and I don‚Äôt want them to know because I don‚Äôt want them to feel sorry for me or not see me as an equal, I don‚Äôt wanna feel less than them. I know they really wouldn‚Äôt love me less, but I feel like they would tip toe around me, or maybe offer to pay, and I don‚Äôt want that, I don‚Äôt need my friends to feel sorry for me, look down at me or anything like that. And maybe for them things wouldn‚Äôt change, but for me they would because I wouldn‚Äôt feel as an equal to them. But I also don‚Äôt want to change schools to one that more ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù because I have really bad anxiety so it‚Äôs really really hard emotionally and mentally for me to do that, since I‚Äôve been in like 7 different schools, so that‚Äôs not an option.

"The overall morality of - ""Mankind"" aka the rich get richer.","First off I live in the states of america and just watching anything from politics to sports and anything really that the ceo aka piggy bank monopoly pigs etc. The entire concept of third to first world countries alone is built to put others down. And not everyone is the same. Not no man, woman and/or child is made the same. Even identical twins don't have the same genetic makeup. Just these two popularized catch phrases. Blood is thicker then water &amp; The story of Cain &amp; Able. All the way to why there is a need of different religions; &amp; if the religion has a belief of living on after a person may flat line and be declared deceased - that there is a life after plain of existence / maybe? Like; my parents would take me to sunday mass, I got baptized, received communion I received the act of reconciliation too - after being forgiven of future sins as a baby. Sadly though not every one has ""Common Sense."" If they see it on a book or a internet website its treated as gospel in today's world. If something is a ""fact"" then there is no need to copyright it too make a profit from it. Just leave it be like the whole college system.

Say if I want to become a teacher for like kindergarten - that type of level. Why should I have to go to any college to learn how to teach; Sharing is caring, be polite, snack time, recess outside, etc etc. If I were to send a loved one to that type of education level. The only thing I would demand of the school is for the entire faculty. Especially the teacher watching the child. Just for said person to be a caring person for a child who is not their own. Respect for a stranger. Sadly almost no one I've encountered has - respect. Middle/high school all the way to frats &amp; sorority aka not everyone care about being a cool kid. I'm not going to be put through a stupid frat boy initiation just to have a place to live on campus. But - The pressures to attain some 15 minutes if fame and/or just to be educated in a field one may have interest in.

On the whole rich &amp; poor debacle. It's all basically fake/monopoly money to begin with; It is the same thing as the federal reserve having any worth to what the so called ""Rich/millionaires/billionaires"" that consider themselves of any decency at all is complete b.s. In all reality regarding - credit card, debit cards, cash, ebt/food &amp; cash benefits is all to stereotype and put groups of people in a fair &amp; unfair stigma. Credit cards are just for the ""Evil"" to feel like they have any value other than being stupid, literally. Food stamps are known for being supplied to those in poverty type of backgrounds. But those you can run out of the ability to buy food. And even then, I used to work at a food store &amp; for some odd reason you could not buy foods that were already made in the store. So if a customer was in a hurry like if they were on break to buy lunch and that was the only means to buy lunch / they would be denied lunch. &amp; then you have a separate category to buy things like cleaning supplies like soap &amp; so forth. And in connecticut - it is always less then the food portion.

Credit cards they have capital one, discover card, and even major chain stores like macy's and so on you can get a macy branded credit card / Literally because its known for expensive clothing lines &amp; they even sell jewelry too. But they have kay the diamond store for those special tv ad runs for times like valentines day etc. In that aspect. In the 1990's the name 'blood diamonds' were a real issue. But if you research it; I'm not going to do this for those that are too lazy. Science wants to dig hundreds of miles below the planets crust to find more diamonds. But these american championship team rings have more and more of these rocks on each of them. Another year - even more shiny gems and stones; The ""midas touch effect."" But say if you propose to someone, its glorified that you use a diamond ring and during holy matrimony you replace it with a wedding band that appears - gold in color. But then these celebrities that you witness on tv like to get married and then get divorced a couple months later just to repeat the ego stroking. How they have to announce it on tv and these tmz magazines.

No one uses any common sense or logic anymore.

Just look at the phrase ""History Repeats"" &amp; ""Why did the chicken cross the road? To me it means. To Put your self in another persons shoes aka. Have at least common decency like the respect not to assume by putting words in a persons mouth."" World war one to world war two which was separated by just about only two decades. But no one begins to think that Germany was never supposed to have a army to almost conquer all of europe. They could have beaten russia. &amp; any one with any real common sense knows they could have beaten them. You don't have the wisdom to build all the advanced air / land / sea vehicles-  to just forget to properly prepare for that terrain. ""Fake News!"" How they have world war's dvd collections and my dad has a high definition tv box set about world war 2. I doubt they had news tv teams with hd cameras covering normady; To Albert Einstein - a astrophysicist building the atomic bomb is a complete contradiction to the man himself. Which is why I guess former politicians need secret service protecting them.. If they can no longer be president then whats the point. They can no longer write their name on a piece of paper.

Also Nikola Tesla had the working theory for ""Free"" sustainable energy for anyone on earth to benefit from. But back before then turn of the century there were concerns about running out of fuel for cars which anyone can drive. People drive without a permit and/or license all the time. And even still they let someone who gets caught driving under the influence keep the same privilege. Just slap them on the wrist - pretty much put a kid in timeout.. But there are more and more planes/nasa ships/cars/diesel trucks/battleships. Its the calender year 2020, but the year 2021 will be celebrated a full day later then last years event. But I live on the east coast of america / I'll just wait my turn to call a person if they live on the west coast - say. 

Yet these middle east princes that are known for the wealth based on the earths oil are so rich they get to sit behind castle walls. Osama Bin Laden I guess had all his oil money sitting in a cave somewhere apparently. But each year they report how terrorists are destroying these oil pipe lines - which is the most idiotic thought ever in today's world / Which is why at a typical gas station they have different priced oils for typical vehicle + they have diesel for extra big trucks. Its the same thing for fuel for the body.. They have fentanyl in baby formula, hormones in skim milf to whole milk \[still has hormones on the labels\]. Processed food to organic food. Mcdonalds/burger king/taco bell etc. etc. Now they have almond milk too. Hormones in ""Mad-cow disease / fake cows"" is the exact opposite of the effect hgh may have on a athlete. Especially if you mix in everything in between.

Its all just the greed being evil aka the all telling phrase ""Money is the root of all evil."" The flu shot if I were to go to my local pharmacy has the warning asking if I'm allergic to eggs - for an odd reason, but there is still no cure for the common cold even. Every new harmful fda apprived drug has just as many risks as the other ceo's drug. And if you want the latest newest best thing you need insurance &amp; if you pay out of the pocket the price is always increased while it is under a company patent. After the patent it becomes more reasonable the price. 

Pretty much. A good majority of 1st world nations are controlled by purely evil people. Just north america alone. From the genocide or bullying of the natives when the people with guns visited. All the way to the day of slaves to asians being put in jails after pearl harbor; To segregation and now the governemt has ice to put anyone of latin heritage in - world war 2 type asian encampments. Now we are back to brutalizing those in unfair circumstances &amp; inner city poverty is the best example.

The red cross monopoly is clear example. After it was common wisdom by way of tv networks that the full donation one may put in the cookie jaw never made it to the place after thousand if not millions lose their lively hood because of mother nature. Just a decade plus a few years to have not one but 2 breast cancer awareness months. But there is a new deadlier mutation of this type of cancer. But with breast cancer it used to be known as a common form of a deadly disease that mainly women may be condemned with.. And it goes along with the stigma of the treatment of women in a place of work. From the amount of money they may make as a boss of any type of company &amp; even still there are so many less jobs for women in general; Also that's how desperate these rich men are to have a so called partner in life / Then there is a concept of a person gets a divorce and they have a alimony that they have to split a persons piggy bank wallet. It works both ways though aka gold diggers putting out to these tmz weird people.

"All my written stuff keeps getting deleted randomly, and I don't know what to do."," 

I  understand what Reddit is, for the most part. I understand that each  subreddit has ""rules"", however arbitrary they may be, and often rather  pathetic.

I have a primary account.

Every.  Single. Thread. But. Two. Got. Deleted....All for imaginary breaking of  rules. One subreddit deleted a post I made. It was a story. I spent  days working on the best way to write the story how I thought it would  work best to convey the message. It was a very well written post, with a  pretty cool and well researched concept. It was a very long story.

But  it violated ""several rules, including putting (serious) in the  title""....What? I read through all of the rules, and I missed that one  thing, so you delete my entire post? How about just ask me to take that  out, since I was obviously still new? Maybe make an attempt at  communication before you take such a drastic action? I feel like there  were steps that could have been taken before you instantly delete  something? Just sayin...

Then I  tried to make a post on Star Wars. I was curious about the new movie  that just came out (was about to come out at the time) and it got  deleted because ""the post is upsetting""...didn't break any rules, just  somebody got butthurt. And without downplaying it, it was just a post  asking people about the new movie, what they hope happens. How do you  think the new movies compare to the prequels and the original trilogy.  Did you like them? Did you hate them? Why? What motivates you do like or  dislike something. What do you think about how they portrait the lore  of the Star Wars universe? Very basic questions, because I love Star  Wars. I love the books. I love the lore. I love the movies (all of them,  though the new three are kinda....just lacking. Not really ""bad"", just  kinda off-putting, ya know? anyway...)

I  made a post on the World of Warcraft subreddit. Asking about how people  like flying, or if they dislike it. Why to both, how do you think it  could be improved, what do you think we could do to make flight a more  functional tool....stuff like that. And honest and open discussion. One  that I KNEW would make people very upset. Flight is a very explosive  topic in the WoW community, but I wanted to ask because I wanted to help  be part of a solution, instead of making it worse. So you would think  it got deleted....but nope, they left it up because they saw it for what  it was.

So I go to a story/RP  subreddit. The one I mentioned earlier. A long story, it involves  demons. You can go read it now if you want. But remember that it is now  about 1/8th of what it was intended to be, and now actually makes no  sense and is kind of stupid. But they deleted my thread 17 times on my  primary account. Their reasons were first: It was not a story because it  did not have a clear beginning, middle and end...but it did, and  anybody with two brain-cells could tell it. It literally started with  the person falling asleep. Then the event happens during that. A  physical touch from the demon when the person woke up...pretty clear  ending.  But now, I posted it up on this account. Its missing more than  half the story, has no clear ending, and has a stupid title, but yet  somehow now it follows their guidelines, and 14 people like it, which at  the time was 100%. So why did the community like it, but for some  reasons the mods hated it? Because they are just fascists. I tried it  out. I made several accounts, just to join that subreddit. I made  several different stories, all to varying levels of skill and success. 4  of them got taken down, one was just so bad I deleted it, which was  fine. It was an experiment. The four that got taken down? Just bad  stories. Poorly written, bad spelling and grammar, but still a story.

The  two that did not get taken down? Ugly, no clear ending or beginning,  literally breaking nearly every rule of their precious subreddit, except  for the title rule....So they are just removing posts on a whim,  because THEY don't like it. Which makes me wonder how many other people  have had that problem.

It is  literally THE definition of Fascism. They are taking control of speech,  and deleting anything they do not like, and keeping anything they do  like, all off of an arbitrary system that they do not clearly define  (intentionally) and then they just contradict themselves because they  know what they are doing...

I  have had nearly every post I made on my main account deleted by mods,  except two. Two of my main accounts posts have been kept around, and one  of them is that WoW post, which is actually the only one I thought that  would get taken down, because I figured everybody would just troll it  into oblivion. But ironically and surprisingly, the one thread that was  the most ""triggering"" is the one that got kept up, meanwhile the ones  that I made that were literally just basic questions in a light-hearted  discussion got taken down for a lot of made up rules being broken, even  though I made sure to follow every rule to a T, all because somehow  asking for an open discussion is ""triggering"" to the mods.

Every  community is different, but really each one has a bunch of people in  there who just need control in their lives, and they are pathetic enough  that the only way they can do that, is through a public, anonymous(?)  forum where they literally have god-like powers of control over every  little thing that happens around them.

No, not all mods. I figure that is pretty obvious, but I know some people do not like to have common sense.

I  actually had a very in-depth discussion with the guy who took down my  Star Wars post. It was good and fun, and things ended well.

But  the majority of you mods are pathetic. You guys shoot down creativity  just because YOU can't see why it is creative, and you are so desperate  for control that you are willing to waste HOURS of your day telling  other people what they can and can't say, just so you can feel better  about yourselves.

And to all the good mods out there, keep doing a good job, because the others are trying their best to ruin it

And  to all you turd-burglars out there, trying to be a party pooper? Just  get off of Reddit. You do not have the cognitive capacity to actually be  objective and consistent with what you will allow on your subs.

As  I just proved, with this account, and my story post that you can look  up, the community should decide what is okay to see, not you. They are  the ones reading things, they are the ones coming here to be entertained  or even educated. They are here to have discussions and talk to people  from all over the world.

I guess  what you could say, is that a lot of the mods on this website need to  learn the difference between somebody being new and making common  mistakes on accident, versus the people who are coming into a sub just  to be rude and derail everything. You guys made me ruin my whole entire  story, just because YOU didn't get it, yet the community does, even in  its crappy and overly edited new version that I had to re-write just  because of some dipstick who thought they knew best.

This  site is about the community. And when you do dumb crap like that, all  you do is hurt the community and drive new people away. Ive only been on  here for a grand total of maybe 15 hours, and all I have seen is mods  deleting posts just because they can, not for any actual violation of  their stated rules.

So I decide to rewatch deep space nine. Thought that would be a safe bet, I've watched dozens of episodes of every other star trek with her and she hasn't shown a flicker of interest. Except she fucking loves DS9. OK then.

Then a friend recommends Mr Robot to me, a show about a nerdy computer dude and the infosec world, something that overlaps with interests of mine that my wife wants nothing to do with. But she comes in 10 minutes into the first episode and loves that too. :/

And you might be thinking, well why don't you just watch it while she's asleep and then she can catch up on those same episodes on her own time? That's a reasonable suggestion, except when she's on her own, she watches nothing but Midsommer murders, the chase and bloody Vera.

I think I may have saved a young mans future.,"No idea where to post this, but I‚Äôve got to get this bizarre moment... so here it goes... Im sitting here playing on my computer at 12:15 am and I hear a pretty serious crash outside. 
I take off out there, sorta looking for my shoes but also knowing somebody probably just wrecked a car into a big tree. So no shoes as I take off down the stairs and sprinting to the end of my gravel driveway (thank goodness for the soft ravenclaw slippers on my feet which now need a good washing). At the end of the driveway is a new wrecked mustang into a tree just a foot from the other side of the road. A young guy emerges as the airbag deflated. He‚Äôs walking and talking so my adrenaline starts to subside. He‚Äôs pacing and I tell him to stand still so I can look him over with my flashlight for any wounds he may not realize. He is saying ‚Äúoh my god I fucked up and I‚Äôm going to jail‚Äù. 
I then see a baggie in his hand. 
I say ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs that‚Äù he responds with ‚Äúma‚Äôam please I just gotta get rid of it.‚Äù I say ‚Äúhand it here‚Äù.
He says, ‚Äúthere is a beer too‚Äù I take the baggie and tell him to ‚Äúthrow the beer‚Äù. He says ‚ÄúI only looked down at my phone for a second‚Äù 

911 answered my call. I tell them there‚Äôs an accident and give them
my address. He‚Äôs saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need an ambulance‚Äù I confirm his age of 19 and tell the dispatcher he is declining an ambulance, but he‚Äôll need an accident report and definitely a tow truck. 
I walk back to the house to get my shoes, and get rid of whatever this baggie is in my pocket. 

I get to my room, get my shoes, throw this baggie in my desk drawer and head back outside. He immediately says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay you to keep your mouth shut‚Äù I laugh... and reply, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know what your talking about, keep your mouth shut‚Äù he reply‚Äôs ‚Äúoh thank god‚Äù.

Officers arrive and he‚Äôs talking with them, I decide I‚Äôm going to head back in the house. I tell him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really glad you‚Äôre okay‚Äù. He gives me a giant hug and says ‚Äúthank you so much‚Äù. 

I go back into the house, I get mom and dad settled back down into bed, head into my room and OMG I can smell that baggie. We never had that good of $hit at 19 LOL

From the window, I see the tow truck arrive, and then people who I assume are his parents. He did not go to jail and now his only worry is how to pay for the new mustang he wrecked.",/r/firstworldproblems/comments/egnllj/i_think_i_may_have_saved_a_young_mans_future/,1577516114,0

I (F21) feel like a horrible person because I didn‚Äôt like any of my Christmas gifts I received from my parents. They were completely wrong from the list I wrote for them on their request.,"*rant warning*
So I‚Äôm a college student and so is my little sister, so my parents try to splurge a little with the gifts since they know we cannot afford things during the semester. They asked me for a list of things I wanted, so I put the items, sizes, and colors just in case. Nothing on there was obnoxiously expensive; mostly just lotion, sweat pants, a pair of non-branded sneakers from the DSW clearance section, but they do know that we would much rather get cash than items so we can save that during the year. I know some people feel awkward giving money, so I like to put easy options as gifts. 
Xmas day comes, and they get me a kindle reader and jeans that are not the right color or fit like I specified. The kindle would have been a nice thoughtful gift if it hadn‚Äôt been the exact same type I already owned from high school.
I really hate feeling this way about gifts they hand picked out for me, but I really can‚Äôt help but think I would have rather gotten cash than things that were not wanted. I would have even rather have my parents save their money. 
I love my parents very much, but it‚Äôs just a little disheartening that they completely disregarded the list they asked for.",/r/firstworldproblems/comments/eg7h2t/i_f21_feel_like_a_horrible_person_because_i_didnt/,1577427644,0

Working on Christmas because my scheduling supervisor is a lazy POS,"My hand was hard at work on thanksgiving day. I pulled a double covering a no call no show, so I reasonably request Christmas off.

When he doesn‚Äôt respond for two hours I call his boss up. 

He proceeds to tell me that I‚Äôm ‚Äúruining lives‚Äù. I thought maybe I was dreaming for a second until he says it again. 

Come to find out there were other workers available to work on Christmas who just weren‚Äôt scheduled.

My wife and my son are having Christmas without their father this morning because somebody didn‚Äôt want to do their job properly.

On top of it the office is shut down today so my superiors could enjoy Christmas.

So this morning I reached into my liquor cabinet, grabbed a bottle of Irish cream, brought it in today, and I am currently getting jolly while I piss the day away on Reddit. 


So I call that a win in my book. Merry Christmas to all on this wonderful day.
