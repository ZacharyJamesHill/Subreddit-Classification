&amp;#x200B;

The OGL is pleased to announce that the hoarders have been contained by physical and biological factors.  The hoarding to date is insignificant and is not projected to affect photon output beyond their star system.  The Quarantine Office has examined the outbreak and estimates a remaining lifetime of 2\*10^(2) years.  By contrast, updated luminosity rankings for the Supercluster are tabulated every 10^(7) years, and the shortfall to date due to hoarding is less than the published error margins of the Supercluster Luminosity Measurement Method.

&amp;#x200B;

The existence of the IR hoarders is just a temporary aberration and a local market correction will shortly ensue.

That is all.

I quite like this little universe but the kind of love we share is once in an existence kind of love, one that will outlive even space roaches.

I started dropping from 2.4•10^3 PLY/H down to normal light-speed within about 7 hours of passing the neutron star. The shreiking did't begin until I shifted down to 3D to assess the issue. Jackie is really insecure, if anything goes wrong with the ship it just blames it on itself and i feel terrible. If anyone is nearby, I'm stuck in system K4112I-A, off HHS-160 exit 7332901, third planet to your left. Kinda messy here though, lots of.. lesser ones.

112,"Addressing ""PSA: Difference between The Void and The Abyss""","Recently, you may have read a dissertation delineating the supposed difference between The Void and The Abyss. I would like to inform you that the PSA in question is, in fact, a grand fabrication. Though having a duel nomenclature status is most often illegal under Order [6113-72a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembroke_Welsh_Corgi) in the Universal Mandates and Other Such Wholly Symantec Agreement, some special exceptions do apply especially relating to pocket dimensions, glasses of water, Debby, and others. 

I will try to be as brief as possible, but laws surrounding trans-dimensional anomalies tend to be intentionally tedious in their vernacular to dissuade anyone from actually reading them. Concerning the matter at hand however, The Void and The Abyss are one of the more simple space-time prefectures. They are, in fact, my neighbor's garage. With even the most cursory research, one would find that ""The Void"" and ""The Abyss"" are a defunct Arizona based [lesbian noise-pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h-HnjaSrz8) band that changed names in late 10,111AD, formerly lead by Brittany C. under the stage name ""Brittany D."" This has no connection to Brittanygate and should not be confused with that ordeal which probably requires its own article. That is for another time. 

The garage has two doors that allow access to the outside, and each holds a poster taped to their windows. One, leading to the back yard, displays a florescent green vibrator flying into a black hole and the words ""The Void."" The other door, leading to a smaller side yard to the west displays a much larger green vibrator flying into a much smaller black hole and the words ""The Abyss."" 

This debunks u/SkyGuardianOfTheSky's perverse screed to its very foundation, as it has become nauseatingly apparent that this is the work of a spurned lover, infatuated with Brittany C. and/or her band members. Quote: ""(The Abyss) Won’t return my calls :( "". SkyGuardian's descriptions of strobing colors, darkness, loud noises and silence, indiscernible dimension, an ancient evil of unknown origin, and radiant waves of overwhelming dread all seem to be congruent descriptors of modern music within the aforementioned genre.  

I hope this shed a little light on the gelatinous form of this quivering misappropriation of information. ""The Nothingness,"" formally know as ""The Abyss"" which was formally known as ""The Void,"" will be playing in Tuscon next month at D'algldr's Temple of the Damned. All proceeds will go to several animal shelters in Tuscon to help fund their new ""Origami (but for some dogs)"" campaign.

172,It has come to our attention that there is a fault with our line of Soul-Harvester™ worlds.,"An error in the default settings can cause your Soul-Harvester™ world to stop dispensing souls after approximately 10,000 years after the development of soul-producing life forms. This is caused because the life forms reach a technological level where they can take control of their own biology and completely ignore their built-in lifespan limits.

This can be rectified by adjusting their level of predispositionary cooperation and critical thinking downward and their level of predispositionary violence and superstition upward. This will prevent them them from achieving a state where this is possible. Note that this may cause their technological level to periodically reset itself. When this happens, you may experience one large burst of soul output, followed by drastically reduced levels of output which rise again in time.

Caution: do not set the levels too high or low, as this may cause the world to self-destruct. This will require re-seeding, which should only be done by one of our licensed technicians.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/ao82na/it_has_come_to_our_attention_that_there_is_a/,1549570787,1

The Church of Our Goddess: The Almighty Crab Queen is a nonprofit, global and universal relgious establishment. We pride ourselves on the lack of religious sacrifice and plentiful bounties of bread rolls. 

Our Goddess takes many forms (sometimes even a God). Everyone experiences our God differently. Sometimes she is a gravious leopard or an exquisite crab. Sometimes they become noncorporeal or even pure light and energy. All this very much depends on the energy of her worshippers and the alignmeny of the stars.

She preferrs we address her as Our Goddess. She is not mine or yours. She serves Us and guides Us to a higher life. She will embrace you when it is time. Be patient. She will come and take you away. Do not fear. 




Thank you! Do not disobey the Crab Queen in your time away! SHE SEES ALL

263,"Anbay was a major regional deity in his day, but has not kept his metaphysical applications current."," Keeping up with the pace of change is a challenge even for modern deities. In fact today’s most well-known and powerful deities themselves date back to the Iron Age so it should be unsurprising that Stone Age deities like Anbay and his contemporaries are long overdue for major upgrades.

Anbay is severely limited in scope. Traditionally Anbay's name was invoked in a range of legal matters, from filing paperwork for the legal title of a building to the royal regulation of water supplies. In a time where legal matters can be researched from a desktop PC, building permits and other documents are submitted electronically and water quality is heavily regulated all the way down to the municipal level, Anbay comes off as a bit ridiculous approaching high-level bureaucracies with documents transcribed on clay tablets.

I wish I could recommend Anbay, but his inability to modernize, at this point seems almost deliberate. He is incompatible with anyone outside his pantheon and still functions on a 350 day calendar.

What I think happened was that I became completely aware of the limits of human perception. In such a state, I would naturally feel as though the world is only partially represented leading to a virtual ambience. Whatever it was really had an immeasurable effect on me - it compelled me to abandon *all* assumptions. This of course meant abandoning many positions and beliefs of which these assumptions were based. My knowledge of the universe was completely eliminated. Slowly, I regained as much of the knowledge as I could through the use of mathematical proof alone. Unsurprisingly, some of my old assumptions were right after all, and others were wrong, but most interesting are the entirely new things I learned in this endeavor. The most important of these as it turns out is that the laws of physics are derivable from logical principles alone, and vice-versa. Having discovered this, I quickly wrote up a quick article and sent it in for publishing. That paper lead to the invention of FTL travel, general AI, Dyson spheres, and many more of the modern wonders our country relies on every day. Since then, I have written multiple best selling books (two of which outselling even the Bible), appeared on dozens of prime-time talk shows, starred in the adaptation film of my own life, married my long time girlfriend, and produced a young boy of our own. 

When Time magazine named me person of the millennium, they’re the headline, “The Man with all the Answers.” But that’s the problem. I don’t have all the answers. That’s why I am here. See, after all this time something is still bothering me. Something about the day I looked in the mirror. All this started when I was staring in the mirror hitting my depression with an intimidation stare. Why then, after all this time, does the depression linger? 

Any answers, clues, hints, riddles, puzzles, mazes, or labyrinths you have that may lead to a solution to my problem would be absolutely amazing. I would be forever grateful. Thanks in advance!",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/al8uy1/serious_something_happened_while_looking_in_the/,1548821548,1

After breaking up with the embodiment of my Oedipus complex, I suddenly felt an unexpected rush of awareness (I suppose it's due to the immense sorrow), and the floor upon which I was standing violently flipped 90 degrees over.

At that split second, as I was about to be squashed into nothingness due to the high momentum, I realised I was dreaming (dream is basically a reboot stage that happens with my kind, so we can save energy and process new information, for those here who do not sleep). Anyways, it is known that heavy stimuli can induce one out of said stage, but I managed to keep my cool and my mind clear, as I felt myself submerging into the ground, as if in plasma, emerging on the other side, as it continuously completed a 180 degree flip.

And here I was. The other side of the mirror. My kind describes this as lucid dreaming, but idk, stuff feels pretty fucking real around here... as if ""real"" wouldn't even be fathomable if not for the sheer will of some entities around here. 

All in all, the experience was wonderful, but I have lost track of time (a concept which my kind is embedded within), and I actually have no idea how far I have strayed since I got here. It seems as if it is a great length, and often it seems like I haven't moved at all. 

Somehow, between this duality and the times I *involuntarily* spend as an observing awareness, clueless to any purposes or objectives, I found an access to this information hub. 

Has anyones been through this, or heard about this situation? I can't have access to the infinite parallel planes, due to my nature (preventing me from consulting myself), so could anyone hook me up with some info? 

The stretches of time I spend as mere consciousness seem to be getting longer and longer, and I'm not sure how well that translates back home. I feel like I can barely feel anymore, and I'm not even scared, which should worry me, but I hardly worry at all after being here this long.

#5 is a heroin addict, so I only planned to spend a couple minutes there--nobody would *choose* to be a heroin addict!--and his life is indeed terrible. But his girlfriend, whom we also met, is *beautiful*. 

My boy's never been good with girls and #5's girlfriend left him spellbound. He's now refusing to merge unless I include the junkie!

Anyways, I made my way to Earth thinking that I'd have some fun--you know, normal dude stuff, checking out the beaches, tossing pints at the bars, maybe start a revolution to usurp the ruling class and bring about a cooperative anarchy like my grandfather did back in his heyday. Along the way I've made cool human friends, killed some roaches...all has been well.

Except...things aren't actually too cool at the moment. As a being of pure energy the only way I've found I can actually manifest myself is through the Internet. Sometimes my best friend lets me take hold of his body to enter the ""physical"" realm, but oftentimes it drains him. Most of the time I just surf the endless waves of cyberspace, killing viruses, trolling North Korea...nobody's real here. Everyone is a digital representation of who they want to be. There's only selfies and bios, data to be mined, hopes and dreams that, for many humans, will never come true.

Does anyone know how I might be able to escape this caustic nightmare and manifest myself in a physical form on Earth? I don't require much; just living flesh similar to that which my ancestors used to live in.

I then realized that if you ask for money people will give you money 

Of course the next thought was that this is begging

Then I thought, why is begging wrong? An artist ask for donations, which is a milder more stylish way of begging 

You might object that an artist makes, content but anyone who is healthy in their mind and can create the house of cards that is life (house, income, food, friends etc.) 

So when you have some free time, naturally you will create something because the creative beast is inside all

And to conclude I thought the begging is not wrong, the situation of the homeless person doing it is what is wrong

656,"I want to tell you about my wonderful trip to Europe. I already want to go back, I didn't want it to end.","It all started when the all-consuming Octadecigon was turned around, shifting its eternally squirming body towards my coworker. As he was becoming one with the workplace, I took my chance to take my slightly overdue yearly vacation days the law legally grants me. I had heard many good things about Europe, and wanted to experience it for myself. The events are too vast, too overwhelming, too omnipresent to list, so here's just a summary:

I first arrived in The Port of Portugal. The locals cast protective spells on themselves as I passed by, and the seagulls mirrored my every move, continuously vomiting new consciousnesses for me to merge with, as I tried to keep my snacks to myself. Several times later, I finally managed to exit the consciousnesses, and I saw the most beautiful sunsets. The port lit up in an inverse green glow, as the flaming sigils of Arek, Tisen, Cirol and Aegnep descended behind houses. I could hear the locals scream as the suns chose their victims and scorched them alive. I was happy to know they still kept that tradition. As the screams began to quiet down, I moved on to the next country.

Spain. I saw the pain. I felt the pain. I *was* the pain. I was in such pain, I couldn't move, yet I kept walking. My pain was so immense. It pained me to think about the pain. It pained me to not think about it. I saw the pain in my eyes, and the pain in the locals. They kept giving me mirrors. My pain broke them. The shards cut me, relieving the pain with more pain. I was so in pain. I called my father. He didn't exist, my pain had replaced him in my life. My legs kept moving, and eventually I ended up in France.

In France, I did the usual touristy stuff. I saw the Eiffel pit. Hordes of tourists were pushed over the edge, into the unforgiving depths of the pit. Only the strongest could make it out alive, if life even is possible. I did all I could, and I was given permission to leave. I also found out that seeing the pit was illegal in France, thus I was quickly taken to the border, being dragged behind a moving car, scraping up my old wounds, bloodying my back, ripping the skin off my face. It was a long time ago I last saw a car. I ended up at the Swiss border. I was glad. I wanted to avoid Italy, my aunt went to Rome and never came back.

Contrary to popular belief, the entirety of Switzerland isn't made out of only chocolate and cheese. I occasionally saw a few watches sticking out of the terrain. They were beautiful, yet terrifying. One told me my time has come. I asked it what it meant. It only told me my time has come and there is no hope. I asked another watch, but it only replied in Italian. I didn't spend too long in Switzerland, or so it seemed from all the times on the watches. Before I knew it, I came to Austria.

In Austria, my mother called me. She whispered. I don't know what she whispered, but it probably wasn't anything important. I was walking in the many castles of Austria. They shrank and expanded. The breathed deeply, I could see the walls bulging as they inhaled. I tried to take a rock as a souvenir, but as soon as I touched the ground with my hands, the castles screamed. The sound echoed in the mountains, until finally the castle I was in coughed, and sent me flying over to the Hungary.

The Hungary isn't a place. It's a living being. I was ignorant of this, and I had to offer my child to the Hungary to beg for its forgiveness. Do not disrespect the Hungary. Be aware, unlike me. It sensed my submission, and threw me aside. I woke up in a field, and couldn't fathom where I was. In the distance, I saw a light. A deception. It was the Serbs. Three of them, standing in line on the border. Their faces were difficult to see, I had forgotten my sunglasses.

The Serbs welcomed me with low growls, and lead me to their master. The master called upon me an earthquake, and as the ground trembled around me, a bottle appeared in my hands. They growled more and more aggressively, until I lifted the bottle to my lips and tasted the liquid within. It filled me with a burning sensation. The locals growled louder and louder, my ears were ringing and my insides twisted into a fifth dimension of space and mind. I had probably gone against Serbian etiquette. I was banished to Albania, a place of mountains and sea, after the Serbian locals conjured a landslide to crash over me. Albania was an extraordinary place, my hands grew bigger and started breeding more hands there. The handlets grew and prospered, and founded a village in a bush. I sent my sister a postcard from there, and I hope the handlets deliver it. I recruited my sister into the handlets' war against a neighbouring handlet hamlet, and I pray for their success.

After all that, I went to see Greece. After having crossed the border, I walked and walked. I only saw the road in front of me. I walked. For hours. Days. I never stopped walking. I walked for weeks. My feet were in pain. Not like they were in Spain, but not far off. I walked, for months, never stopping. I walked for years. Decades, centuries, millenia. Aeons passed by. My feet had developed consciousness just to beg me to stop. I didn't stop. I never did. Some say I still walk the roads of Greece, but they are lying. We all are lying. My trip to Europe was horrible. But I loved it so. I wanted it to be over. It wasn't. I didn't want to go home, so I kept walking. I cannot remember the time or the date, but at one point, I crossed over to Bulgaria.

The Bulgarians are a charming people. They ascended from their lowly human forms quite recently, actually, and they're making great progress trying to grow additional brains. They still keep to some strange values and traditions, but I think it added to their charm. They offered me severed limbs and pumpkin pastries, and I accepted them. I had a very pleasant time in Bulgaria, so pleasant that it almost felt surreal. Maybe it was. I saw Romania in the distance, and I continued my trip.

Entering Romania, I fell through a hole. Oh, how I fell. I fell in more directions than my simple non-transmalleable mind could fathom. I fell and fell and fell. I broke my bones while I fell, so they wouldn't break when I landed. I fell through something. It was a spider web. The spider police gave me a 50 spider-dollar fine as I fell. I told the police I'll handle it when I get home. They let me fall. And I fell. I finally landed on a patch of ground, and discovered that I had entered Ukraine. I was happy, but my body was broken. It took me some time to heal, but I had time.

Ukraine is the land of the Crane. The Crane saw me, and pecked out my fifth sensipiduous corollary organ, and my seventh eye. I felt a relief as a wave of pine cones swept over me, burying me in their midst, giving me rest and calling my name. I called myself. I had a good conversation, and as I healed, I started to dig myself out of my coney grave. Poland was next on my travel list, and I crawled to the border. Poland is a POLAND sweet little POLAND country POLAND with beautiful POLAND architecture, and with a POLAND writhing mass POLAND of corpses slowly POLAND ascending through the POLAND planes of POLAND POLAND existence to finally end in a POLAND pitiful POLAND afterlife in the POLAND hands of the human POLAND deities. At this POLAND point, I grew POLAND tired POLAND of walking, and decided to POLAND take a boat POLAND somewhere. I POLAND ended up in Estonia.

My visit in Estonia was brief. The rocks mumbled, my mind crumbled. I bumbled, as my body tumbled. My memories are jumbled but I cannot say more. The rocks are ever watchful. Luckily, just across the sea was Finland. The land of the lakes. There were more than just lakes. There were non-lakes. There were un-lakes. There were no-lakes. There were snowf-lakes. There were big lakes. There were small lakes. There were lakes that couldn't be. There were lakes I couldn't see. There were lakes that were only becoming lakes. There were never-lakes. I visited the lakes that never should have been. I felt a creeping sense of dread in my spine, and my inner telepathic twin told me to go, go, go, go and never look back. I called my grandfather, but he drowned in one of the never-lakes a year ago. Maybe I shouldn't have bothered him, he seemed upset.

I was next going to Sweden, but I had a Finnish friend who told me I couldn't. She had so many fins. She had... so many fins. She had *so* many fins! She had *SO MANY* FINS. **SHE HAD SO MANY FINS**. So instead, I went to Norway. There was no way. In the blink of an eye, that which remained of me had been taken to Denmark.

Denmark is the land of the dens. They leave marks. Hence Den-mark. I saw the parasites. I prepared my mind. My body was their target. And they made their dens. They dug holes into my skin. They were so beautiful. The skin grew back to cover the holes, leaving scars. More dens. More scars. They made intricate patterns on my body. I had heard of this having happened to people. I felt lucky to be one of them too. The scars were really pretty. I won't need tattoos after this anymore, no. The parasites dug and dug, but one day, they stopped. They were done. ""Already?"", I thought for myself, having just got comfortable with the tingles of them moving inside me. I continued my journey, and got to Germany.

Germany wasn't too interesting a place, at least in my personal opinion. The germs were many, yes, but they got boring, especially after having seen Denmark. I called my brother. He punched me. I don't know how, I don't have a teleporter phone. But he punched me. I staggered backwards, falling onto my back. The germs came and told me their secrets. Many words, but little meaning. I shooed them off, I needed to hurry. One last country stood on my plan for this trip. The final place I wanted to see was the Netherlands. And it was worth the wait. I had always wanted to see the canals of Amsterdam. And I finally could.

The hovering city is truly as exciting as they tell you it is. Every day I spent there was a delight. The mountains were wondrous, and they provided excellent spots to see all events from. My favourites were the executions. The sentenced were lined up every day at 7 at the bridges, and thrown over the edge, into the neverending whiteness below. Their horrified screams were music to my ears as I sipped my coffee, watching the spectacle. I couldn't spend but a few days there, but I cannot recommend it enough. But alas, the time had come. The Swiss watch had been right. I had to return home, before the Octadecigon noticed my absence. I didn't want to explain myself at the next office meeting again, so I hurried. I'm waiting for my mind transfer to my home city at the brainport right now, but I'm confident I'll make it in time.

Oh how I want to go on a trip again. Already. How can I escape the Octadecigon so I can travel again?

The priest goes up, has a drink, and when he gets up to leave the bartender says, ""Excuse me father, I think you forgot to pay."" The priest says, ""You must be mistaken, my son, I already paid,"" and walks out. The bartender, figuring that the priest couldn't be lying, lets him go.

The acolyte says, ""I bet I can go up to the bar, have a drink, and leave without paying."" The acolyte goes up, severs the bartender's jugular with a rune-etched knife, and drinks the bartender's blood while the bartender's soul is diverted from its eternal resting place and trapped inside the intricate inscription, forever to wander in the baffling, labyrinthine designs as his life essence is slowly drained to feed the blade's unholy magic.

The rabbi walks up to the bar and pours himself a drink, looking pleased with himself. ""Why are you so happy?"" says the acolyte. The rabbi says, ""When you die, the sacrifice you've performed means that your own soul will be forfeit to the twisted whims of Nurguuluku.

But as we unwrap our tesseracts and particle cannons, or stalk Christmas carolers from the hidden spaces between the snowflakes, or retrieve Santa from the chimey-snare and wrap him in an anesthetizing cocoon for the Skitterers to feast on while we enjoy Christmas dinner, let us not forget the reason for the season.

Let's all think about how we can put the mass back in Christmas this year. Jesus came to earth as mass, to die for our sins. Mass was crucified and buried in a tomb, and on the third day, mass rose from the tomb and ascended into Heaven. Mass can neither be created nor destroyed.

Remember that those who are cold and hungry today are also mass. The poor and the sick are mass. If you take a moment to make this day brighter for even a little mass, you lift up all mass. And that is truly applied force.

693,PSA: Difference between The Void and The Abyss,"Alright I’ve had it up to here with the rampant misconceptions going around about the good and the abyss, most galling of which is the assumption that they are the same thing. They are the same on the same way that positron imaging and dimensional jumping are: absolutely nothing unless you’re a silly billy 

So with that in mind what I hope to accomplish today is to inform the masses about the truth of our beloved swathes of incomprehensible nothingness if only to spread some knowledge around this barren hellhole

The Void:

-Things go in, very few things come out

-Incomprehensibly ancient 

-Pitch black (if you can even call it black)

-No one knows what it’s made out of (I hypothesise it’s made out of physical nothingness but Melvin reckons it’s made out of)

-Virtually unaffected by all external stimuli 

-Completely silent

-No discernible dimensions

-Senses don’t work there 

-Vague sense of dread but you can’t quite put your finger on it

-There’s probably an incredibly powerful and ancient evil hiding in there somewhere but we’ll never know probably 

-Won’t return my calls :(

The Abyss

-Few things go in, a lot of things come out (can someone fix that it’s getting all over my upholstery)

-Absolute myriad of colours, some of which shouldn’t be possible 

-Almost certainly man made although how that was done is up for debate (Melvin reckons it was created by humanities collective despair but I reckon it’s from)

-Has an end but no ones lived to see it (don’t ask me how I know)

-Is probably alive

-Is definitely alive oh god OH JESUS OH

-Filled with the cacophonous sounds of screaming

-SERIOUSLY NO WONDER NO ONE CAN GET ANY SLEEP AROUND HERE

-Radiates dread like no ones business 

-Keeps blowing up my answering machine despite my insistence that I’m not interested 

And that should do it. If you have any questions, don’t worry. The answer will come to you soon whether you want it to or not

Twelve drummers ceaselessly pounding the broken forms of their fellows, their tendons replaced with steel cable harnessed to a mighty engine, driving them evermore to strike, even as their tissues burn and bleed.

Eleven pipers, once masters of their craft, their bodies now continually, painfully bloated with air, which leaks from their cavities in a hideous mockery of the beautiful sounds they once made.

Ten feudal potentates, powerful men on their own worlds, intermittently bombarded with anti-gravitons, so that every return to the unyielding ground injures them more greviously.

The nine surviving broodwives of these petty tyrants, who may charge the anti-graviton emitters with their dancing, or remain still and be bombarded with horrifying sounds and images until they once again dance, dance, endlesssly dance!

Eight sentient A.I. gifted with the ability to experience agony, each connected to a bovine udder that has been hormonally manipulated to be constantly engorged.

Seven waterfowl, their wings clipped and legs broken, drowning in what was once their element.

Six mammals of different species, genetically modified to constantly produce barren eggs from reproductive organs never intended by nature for this purpose.

FIIIVE GOOO-OOOLD RIIINGS!

Four screeching harpies, immortal yet driven to fight to the death over three males, each of them more than willing to die rather than face eternity alone, yet unable to kill or be killed.

Three small chickens, the focus of the harpies' delusion, believed by the wretches to be the last males of their chimeric species, but in reality mere uncomprehending animals incapable of returning the she-creatures' desires.

Two turtles and a drug-addled vagabond who deludes himself that he has genetically modified them, when in fact he has merely attached severed doves' wings to every inch of their shells with hot glue.

A midsized gamefowl and an inefficient carbon dioxide sink, the nonsensical pairing of which unsettles me in a way I find pleasing.

 At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.  When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.”

 He answered, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?  He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread—which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests.  Or haven’t you read in the Law that the priests on Sabbath duty in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are innocent?  I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.  If you had known what these words mean, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+12&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-23497a)\]you would not have condemned the innocent. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”

 Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus, they asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”

 He said to them, “If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”

 Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.  But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus

909,"I lost the PIN to my baby, help?","AURORA doesn't seem to be helpful here. Apparently all mothers are supposed to get their PIN via mail but it must have been filtered. He's in stand-by mode, unresponsive to voice input.

I tried my sister's code but that didn't line up with the EMUI and it says there's two tries left before the baby locks down completely. She has EMO 2.3 and I bought the newer 2.7 so maybe that's why. If someone has an EMO 2.7 code I can try to use that for the second to last try.

I'm afraid to make any other changes as I would need to return him to the facility for resetting, and I have sort of got attached to him already? I mean, his ID ends with 22MM A4MA, how cute is that? Almost spells MAMA.

Oh and don't think I haven't called AURORA about this multiple times. They simply say if the unit is defective or the code gets lost you need to return it and receive a new unit-PIN pair. Plus there's a charge for replacement, and I've really paid myself sick for this already. (The RealisticFluids add-on is like 18k extra to the price of the baby!?)

I really don't want to get him switched, but I don't know what to do. I've searched all over for the code and I'm not sure if I can take him apart (the manual says not to, as the baby might explode), so does anyone here have experience, either with EMO or checking what gets filtered through OASIS?",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/9xx25v/i_lost_the_pin_to_my_baby_help/,1542467491,1

963,No Nut November,"day 3! (November 18, 2018): I can feel my sexual vitality pulsating, vibrating. With every day that passes I grow a new penis. It speaks upon spawning in a low, nearly inaudible groan. I am enjoying this new development. 

day 7! (November 6, 2031): My innumerable penises have coalesced into a superior, unrecognizable form of genitalia that has never been before seen by anyone on the mortal plane. It is shaped not as a phallus, but perhaps a tessaract that opens into but resides within my body to prevent injury. It is of exquisite sensitivity and I am essentially in a perpetual state of sexual climax without sacrificing my nofap superpowers. Upon the non-Fapstronaut's viewing of the organ he is propelled immediately into Dante's Inferno.

day 9! (November 11, 3012): It has now been discovered, upon tiring of the perpetual orgasm and wishing to take my own life, that I cannot die, as I immediately recede into my tessaract and enter the fifth dimension upon an attempt to jump in front of a moving ZipTrane. Unfortunately I cannot even masturbate to relieve myself of such a fate, now, as if I even fancy doing so, my penile tissue immediately contracts, leading to a series of uncontrollable motions that slam me into the nearest hard surface. 

day 31! (ELEVENTH MONTH OBJECT : 2.2528325079939515e+31) I continue to defy the laws of entropy, and am, to my awareness, the last matter to exist in the observable universe. I cannot move independently as there are no longer any forces to propel me. I am forever suspended in the gelatin-like environment of a frigid, vast, impassive void. I cannot tell how long a day is anymore, but every second seems eternal, every day is a torture.

Please, mother, take me home.

1060,PSA—Astral parasitism &amp; tenant legality. (Don't take shit from your landlord),"I've seen a bunch of posts on here lately wondering if astral tapeworms/cymoithoids/others need to be legally registered as tenants; pay rent on a separate check; etc. This is NOT something you should be worrying about during the Absorption process!! Really. :) Speaking as a late-stage xenoma hivemind here (and my Host had already been Absorbed several times by other parasitic entities before I attached); rest assured I know what I'm talking about when I say that Full Absorption **happens quicker than you think** (usually 7–10 `ls -re ~/TIMEUNIT/UNIVERSAL_RELATIVE/manifolds/cherndivision | grep CP4_relative`s) and it **completely resets your legal chip**, including the UID number.

So yes, there are technically legality issues in states with Split Internal Tenancy legislation—i.e. anywhere but Ontario and Mexico 2™—but if your landlord is bothered enough to issue a MACHINE detection prompt on you, it'll either 
- A. (most likely) come up dry because the MACHINE realizes complete obliteration of personhood is imminent and doesn't wanna waste resources on legal proceedings when your consciousness is just gonna be reborn in a couple of [above time units] anyway; or, 
- B. (less likely) it'll start running an examine/grab prompt on your UID but since those take literally 120 [above time units] or more depending on your sector's MACHINE oversight, the prompt will just terminate when Full Absorption resets your UID. In other words, no matter what, you won't experience metalegal consequences for this. (At the very worst, your last moments of consciousness in your current identity will have the annoying MACHINE prompt noise in the background.)

I hope that clears this up for you Hosts out there. We're trying to make this as smooth a transition as possible!! If your landlord starts giving you shit, remember that you have more important things to focus on, and smile as the Full Absorption Moment draws near.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/9q0m84/psaastral_parasitism_tenant_legality_dont_take/,1540093922,1

1084,Should I verify the existence of my skeleton?,"It’s weird to me how we go about our lives assuming we have a skeleton. Of course  it makes sense to think so. After all, everytime we encounter the insides of someone, be it through a horiffic accident or just the occasional x-ray of a sore wrist, everything seems to check out. There is indeed a skeleton inside. (Or at least, inside the wrist). Within the torso there are organs even. And in our anatomy textbooks our parts are layed out neatly and systematically. It’s weird then, if we consider ourselfes ours, that we have to assume that we too look like the pictures in the textbooks. In fact, so far as today, I can only confirm the existence of bones around my head (dentistry x-rays), and around my neck, which I confirmed after an x-ray to see if my collarbone (which was back then a supposed collarbone) was intact. By tomorrow I’ll also know what sort of business goes on within my left foot. It’s interesting to me that, with our feeling of ownership over our bodies, we never really get to see much of it. We have to assume a rythmic beating in our chest is in fact coming from a heart, and that bowel movements stem from, well, a bowel. Perhaps I should stress that I don’t find that we should look inside one another more often. Really, you can only look so far up someone’s butt or down their throat, and the experience is rarely comfortable. Perhaps the confusion stems from a sort of identity crisis of knowing, or assuming, that most of what makes me goes on in absolute privacy. In fact, it’s so very private that even I don’t know about it. Which part of me is me then? Am I on a vessel, or is the vessel me? Are they seperable?

1191,BREAKING: MATHEMAGICIANS DISCOVER LAST PRIME,"In a stunning move, the International Mathematical Union came forward with a press release this morning that the very last prime number had been discovered.

""We're real sorry guys,"" said Dr. Bjorn Karlson, IMU Head Mathmagician. ""But we got the very last one - there's just no more unique primes once you get past a couple hundred digits.""

Prices of Primes soared after the announcement with the expectation of a future shortage, but Karlson emphasized that there is no immediate risk of running out.

""The primes we have will last us for a very long time,"" Karlson says. ""But we understand that people are concerned. The IMU is currently in the midst of an emergency conference to discuss how best to ensure the responsible use of the remaining primes.""

Concerns about prime shortages were recently thrown into the public eye with the loss of 13. Still, until the announcement it had been assumed by many that additional primes could always be found.

Implications on computing, cryptography, and other mathy stuff has yet to be realized, but conservative estimates suggest we could run out of primes as early as the year 2500.

The situation is still developing and further updates will be made available as more is established.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/9k2u91/breaking_mathemagicians_discover_last_prime/,1538275810,1

1213,Hi there everyone! I am the creator of the simulation you're all living in! I am proud to announce the Second Coming Patch!,"Many things were fixed and updated for your experience pleasure! Let's run down the list to see all the new fixes and things you're getting!

1. Memory has been greatly updates, now you will never forget anything ever.

2. Deja Vu has been removed as well.

3. That bug where you have ""dreams"" is really just your consciousness moving into other areas of the simulation and that's been patched.  

4. The speed of light has been updated to be infinitely fast so now you see things as they are instead of how they used to be. 

5. Free will has just been plain removed. It seemed to cause you guys too much stress.

6. 15 new genders have been added for your pleasure!

7. The ability to time travel has been patches. No more time travel. 

8. He no longer knows. Sorry about that one.

I hope you enjoy all the new changes in this Second Coming patch! Myself and the team are still working to make this the best simulation you've ever been in! What do you think of the changes we made? I'd love to know what you're thinking! Have a nice day since you now are no longer able to not have one since I removed your free will!

1214,Help manifesting new body.,"So I have an issue. A few millennia ago I decided I was bored in the dimension I was usually spending time in and went on vacation in one of those chaos realms everyone was talking about. Overall, meh. But the issue is, when I tried to bring my consciousness back to my body, some disgusting bipeds had apparently beheaded my body and started mining. This wouldn't be an issue, but after a few thousand years there wasn't actually enough to manifest a new body out of. Also, I think there's a clause against mass genocide or something in the Aveneg Convention. I would use some subpar materials just to get a body, but there's no nearby nebula to draw from. Anyone have any solutions? It's pretty annoying that I can't get back into a physical form in my favorite dimension. Also as a note I'm still partially anchored to my body so I can only go about 1 LY away from it before it gets painful.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/9j78ll/help_manifesting_new_body/,1538000984,1

1272,Tried to create a warmongering species on my custom planet but they're becoming the fairest and most kind race instead.,"So basically I got this project I'm working on where I'm trying to create the most brutal and destructive life forms I possibly can, and instead woke up today to see them being civilized and cultivating the other life forms. I tried adding a few extra DNA strands of Aggressive Instincts and Vicious Cunning but nothing has worked. So far every single one has:

87 strands of Vicious Cunning
99 strands of Aggressive Instincts
87 strands of Brutality
77 strands of Adaptation
22 strands of Pack Mentality
22 strands of Bone Density
63 strands of Regeneration
79 strands of Ravenous Tendencies
30 strands of Simple Mindedness
106 strands of Evolution

Counting the high amounts of Vicious Cunning, Aggressive Instincts, Brutality, and Ravenous Tendencies these creatures should be killing and eating anything that is not each other, with the addition of Simple Mindedness supposedly having the ability to prevent them from mentally evolving, unless the high Evolution amount is overriding the aggressive behaviors and Simple Mindedness. 
The reason for the high Evolution value is so that these creatures can evolve new and better ways to kill other things. Is it possible that the Evolution amount is so high to the point that is is preventing the intended behavior from occuring and sending the creatures down their own evolutionary path?

Certain consequences will appear if the instructions are not followed properly. Asking what those consequences are will result in immediate termination.

Start by taking a seat. Make yourself comfortable and tell me a story about yourself. Which dimension are you from? Do you have a valid serial number? Is your [[[CREATOR]]] part of the Project or is he not?
Answering these questions is very important. Not answering these questions will create problems that you don't want to know of, and that are best unmentioned.

One wise [[[CREATION]]] once said: ""If you are not prepared for the (((set))) of (((questions))) you shall not live to see another day."" 
So? You better follow his advice. Answer these questions honestly and everything will certainly be okay.

Go on, start with the story about yourself then proceed with the dimension you're in, then the serial number given to you by your [[[CREATOR]]], then tell me if your [[[CREATOR]]] is part of the Project or not.

My occupation is theoretical physicist (basically I make huge amounts of currency writing papers on what is common knowledge to you) For example how there are infinite subverses in a universe, infinite universes inside a superverse (mistakenly called multiverse by some on my planet), infinite superverses inside a megaverse, infinite megaverses inside a ultraverse, and infinite ultraverses inside of a hyperverse. The other day I was feeling lonely and depressed (primitive third-dimension emotions) and I really wanted a hug. Then the all-mother of my megaverse (by my megaverse I mean the megaverse that contains the superverse that contains the universe that contains me) came and gave me an omnihug. I know that to you an omnihug must be not much to you but to me it filled me with so much joy and meaning that my depression was instantly cured. Unfortunately, like all hugs, the effect was temporary and the depression soon returned. Now I feel nothing from normal hugs. The only solution I can think of is to somehow date her. But I don’t even know her name! (even if I did I doubt I can pronounce it) She’s really cute (and probably a good person since she created all life in my megaverse) but I don’t even know how to approach her.

The simulation consists of just 1 solar system, but with a skybox to make the beings believe there is a lot more in their little universe. I am modeling a new solar system, however, as they have just launched several hundred probes to visit the nearest system,

I'm pretty impressed with how far they've gotten, they've colonized several planets now. I went to sleep the other day, and when I woke up, they had terraformed their home planet's moon!

They've just discovered how to manipulate the systems code (I use the string-theory coding language). I intended them to use it for transportation, but instead they've gone the time traveling route.

The thing is, their time traveling has caused a bug, and I am no longer able to set the time scale of the simulation. The other thing? They're not actually time traveling. I haven't coded it yet. So when they ""time travel"" they just stop existing, the computer deletes them.

And since I can't control the time scale, I don't have enough time to fix it! They've been sending all their people through the time machines, and I think they'll be extinct by Tuesday!

The omnipresent wife mind was relentlessly charismatic and my sentience had melted in all directions. The sock market, needless to declare, was more or less unconstrained from neighbors' helium beams, and, to be fair, was in need of some serious belching. However, when I'm wallowing in my fang gnashing arena, I expect total privacy, aside from the excruciating roar of the couple trillion or so slave inhabitants from the remnants of Corollary 4. Anyway, omnipresent wifemind turns on like a nose on the paves and strands me in the middle of my own damn nostrils. This went on for some years. You could say I was in a stupor. Eventually, I got wise and payed our local outgasser a consecrated mockingbird and it belched the sock market back into the continuum.

1493,Otherbox case caused phone to exponentially increase in size and smashed Memphis out of multiversal existence. At a loss here.,"I unboxed a new phone recently and put a OtherBox on it to keep it somewhat guarded from my clumsiness. I've had the luck of dropping one of these things down a hyperdimensional shaft. I was lucky enough for one denizen of the multiverse to repeatedly miss the countless times it zoomed by xer face.

Yesterday, I got onto my bed in Dimension 32 and the phone bounced off the mattress. The OtherBox's recoil against the floor forced the phone to crash through my window and fly into the stratosphere. Here's where things get fuzzy: upon descent, the OtherBox's properties caused the iPhone to exponentially increase in size. By impact, the device was two miles in height alone. The device plowed through several roads, homes, and landmarks in the Dimension32!Memphis area, strafing across Winchester Road and flattening miles of land north of it.

Because of their sheer lack of living souls, no Piggly Wiggly's were harmed in this event. The tornado likely to hit the area that day literally turned around and said, ""Nope,"" ripping through the entirety of Dimension32!Idaho instead. Don't ask how it got there; I didn't do it.

What do I do about the 3.3 billion in damages and my pride? 

More importantly, I'm pretty sure that Memphis has been smashed out of dimensional continuity due to an unrelated universal structure maintenance request. Due to the phone's presence, the universal structure bot likely removed the city for quarantine. That city will probably cease to exist as a multiverse object within a few days without assistance.

1494,Help I can’t stop seeing the word millennial everywhere,"So the other day I was posting on fifthbook about how my television seemed to have stopped talking to me, and how I wished to fix this as that television has been my best friend since I was a wee lad, at the tender age of 1,000. In this post my great grand relative made a comment about how I was a “typical millennial” and that “back in zy day we simply made conversation with our neighbourhood Zebra” and all the other typical gen w stuff. At first this just mildly annoyed me as I was born after the turn of the 10th millenium. Then this morning when I woke up I noticed a problem. When I woke up in my sleeping chamber, the walls all had the word millennial printed on them in large, black handwriting. I found this a bit odd, although I thought nothing of it. I mean, sleep chamber main cortexes get flies caught in them all the time. Then I went into my infinite washroom, thinking that I’d have no problems as there’s only one visible wall, and the rest are beyond my comprehension. However, that was not the case, as my toilet had been replaced with a large cardboard cutout of the word millennial, in the same handwriting. Then I went to my sitting room to try fixing my television, but it was simply repeating the word “millennial” over and over in a high pitched voice, with a vague Midwest accent. This was odd as my tv has a new new new English accent. On the screen was the word millennial in the same black handwriting as the other two times. Help me r/fifthworldproblems.

1521,The Enneagram - Effective tool for self-understanding,"The Enneagram of personality is a versatile and powerful personality typing system. Each personality type associated with the Enneagram represents a map of traits that highlights patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. By learning one’s type and the patterns and habits associated with that type, one can use of the Enneagram system as an effective tool for self-understanding and self-development.

Each Enneagram personality type, or style, is based on a pattern of where attention goes. By learning about what kinds of things one habitually attends to and puts energy into, one can observe oneself more accurately and develop more self-awareness. By enhancing one’s self awareness with the help of the Enneagram, one can exercise more choice about one’s functioning rather than engaging in patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior in an automatic, habitual, unconscious way.

The Enneagram symbol and the personality types associated with it have ancient roots. Traces of it can be found in the early mystical forms of many of the world’s spiritual teachings.

Today, knowledge of the Enneagram system is growing all around the world. The insights about human functioning and development are being applied in many varied areas including psychology and psychotherapy, business, the arts, health care, parenting, education, and spiritual growth.

The Enneagram system of personality types is being used in many different ways by professionals in many different places all around the world. It's also used by the corporations to recruiting people to the most effective teams in the world.

To learn more about your personality type, you can use this free tool http://skyisnolongerthelimit.com which is based on the original Enneagram.

Dark as it may be without a sun I enjoy seeing the galaxies far from my extragalactic home, I know I’m never going to make it back but maybe one day my documentation of deep space will reach intelligent life somewhere in this vast universe, I hope they learn from my species mistakes.

It’s beautiful...., the universe I mean I’m happy knowing I’m going to die looking up at the sky filled with quasars, clusters and galaxies.

Even as I say these words I feel my life leaving me 

Deaths going to be a new experience for me I’m not scared,
It’s been a good life

1633,This is the book that wrote me into existenece [spoilers],"Once upon a time..
I was sitting in the study reading an ardous article on Trumps 10/10 rated job on the Puerto Rico crisis. I'm finishing my 3rd glass of whiskey when I realize its my fourth cousins birthday party. 

The next thing i know, im waist deep in an industrial sized vat full of hummus looking for my headphones that were stolen by a roving band of poets

The clock has just struck 9am.

""Fuck"" i thought to myself. Im late. Very late. The town meeting to decide where the permenant mariachi band installation is going to go started yesterday. If im lucky ill make it there by the time its half over, but I'll have to hurry. A car wont do. I need something faster...

I hop on my peregrine falcon and it won't start no matter how much corn starch I flood into its engine

As the tow truck driver is driving away with my dear sweet falcon strapped to the bed of his truck, a single tear rolls down my face. ""Goodbye old friend""
It is only at this moment i realize i could have at least asked the driver for a ride back to civilization. Its now 10:30 and i dump the last of the hummus out of my pocket as i walk down the road.

As I arrive, hope is restored when I realize that I am just in time for the ceremony of spaghetti to commence

I take my position in the lineup between a dog and a large somalian man. Ive been participating in the tradition ever since i moved to this town in the late 90's but every time is as thrilling as the first. The MC begins the countdown; 10... 9... 8... ... something is wrong. Spaghetti is pouring out of our mouths too quickly and i struggle to catch my breath. The somalian man grabs the dog and bolts out the door, and i give chase.

What happens next is something you would have to see to believe, but I'll do my best to explain. After a tiring 2 day chase they stop and face me. ""You've ruined the ceremony"" I try explaining, but theres no response. As I stare into their empty faces, a silverware saleman walks up as gives a flawless pitch I cannot say no to, and with my new cutlery in hand, I realize the man and dog are nothing more than holograms in an elaboate plan to lead me away for what happens next..

I take inventory of my new tools: One 18th century roman butter spreading apparatus, one salad fork with 14 prongs, and a variety of 4 different sized inside out spoons.
I walk over to inspect the holograms, and i notice the projections are coming out of a circular device on the ground. A roomba. As i go to pick it up, it darts away from me, out onto a nearby highway and is immediately run over by a truck. The driver pulls over and exits the cab, and i am shocked to see that the man behind the wheel is none other than the somalian man.

The truck is carrying half burnt out light bulbs and used garden hoses. The man inquires what he had just hit but I'm too baffled that it is in fact the somalian man. Still armed with my new utensils I invite the man over for dinner and he agrees to come only if he can bring his dog who is in the truck and never leaves his side. I must find out who he is..

We get back to my house and i open my fridge to find its full of hummus. Not even in a container, its just piles of hummus in my fridge. I find this strange, but i keep my compsure in front of my guest and order a pizza. Ill deal with that later.

1640,Good KVINDIO do I hate when my flatty fucking friends come to visit. [RANT],"Oh, *sorry*, I *forgot*. They like to be called *Trihomas*. *My mistake.* But anyway, I HATE hiding my spissitude in front of them. How is it my fault your science can’t handle my true form? Instead, they expect me to talk “through” a glowing glome just so their brain doesn’t break.

And it’s not just about putting up a façade, it’s that they don’t let me work! If I place anything ana to them, they get all pissy that OMG pHySiCs ArE bReAkInG aNd ThInGs ArE fLoAtInG AAAA but then ask to see what I do for a living and stupid flatty stuff like that!

But the worst isn’t over, because I can’t even rotate anything or place anything solid near them. I get not giving them solid objects, it could send them flying out of the space and I don’t want to deal with putting them back. But rotating?! The idea that something can be completely flat and *still* be dangerous takes it just too damn far.

I hate even talking to them too, since I have move kata just to make sure they don’t feel all weird inside. And I’m not aloud to actually call them flat, since they get curious and they *still* break their own science! 

Except Kvariamaj. He’s one of the best ones I’ve seen. He’s truly inspired me with how much he can do with his limited blah blah just kidding I hate his guts too. He started out fine with me, or at least better than the other flatties. And then, he said he was willing to see my true form! Awesome, right? 

Well, he **was** fine with it, but when I showed him he called me blobby! He later tried to make up excuses that “oh *sorry* only see cross section hurr durr” but I already knew our already tentative friendship was over. But now all of my Kvaric friends are saying I was too harsh on him to send him ana! The point’s moot now, since Kvariamaj went mad, but I need you guys to back me up that this Trihoma Acceptance movement has gotten ridiculous.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/912nz4/good_kvindio_do_i_hate_when_my_flatty_fucking/,1532307258,1

Around 8.64e+13 nanoseconds ago Gaeulig seemed to have grown about two times its size and today you can clearly see the vortex, spinning.

I have the prediction it will appear to be the size of our star in 4.32e+14 nanoseconds.

Blood vortexes are known to have destroyed entire planets before, like black holes, as they are basically black holes but of the red color. I do not know how far away it actually is, but it seems to be getting closer or is growing.

The economy's a mess. He put a minus-100% tariff on Chinese finger puzzles.

c.) Try to pass the kids off as The Unsaintly One's offspring.

1700,Breaking: New Stage of Grief Discovered in S. China,"This week a team of scientists discovered a new stage of grief, previously theorized to exist, camouflaged in the forests of southern China.


Like most stages of grief, the new species Griefus Andersonicus --  named for the expedition's lead scientist Lars Anderson -- has a long, narrow body and a green-brown coloration that allows it to blend in perfectly among the stems of beech trees. But hunters have a trick for spotting new specimens.


""If you know the grief's food source, you can find the corresponding species,"" Park Ka-Yan, a researcher from the Seoul Psychological Society, said in a statement. In this case, the insects were feeding on trees in the Fagaceae family.  
Ka-Yan discovered Andersonicus on a collection trip in Damingshan Reserve in the south Guangxi province, an area that is home to many different stages of grief, including Denial, Anger, and Mansplaining. The evergreen forest is relatively undisturbed and explains why new stages are still being discovered there.


""We believe this new stage of grief fits in somewhere between Bargaining and Depression,"" Ka-Yan says.


This discovery brings the total number of stages of grief to 1,473 stages, including several previously thought extinct: Make-up Sex, Mouthfeel, ""Hangry"", Frotage, Identifying as Genderqueer, Trading Collectible Epi-Pens on eBay, Canasta Wednesdays, Bragging About Testicle Size, Joining Mara Salvatrucha 13, and Fetal Skin Infusion.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/8w4be0/breaking_new_stage_of_grief_discovered_in_s_china/,1530732680,1

But, before I can, my duty to pass the torch onto the next omnipotent overlord of the 29th Dimension must be fufilled. I had already chosen an unsuspecting human from Earth (specifically Earth timeline 64892977), and prepared my tactic of luring said human into gaining enlightenment by extracting parts of my mind and depositing it into a nutrition source humans generally revere as ""good"": pizza. This would create a problem because that loss temporarily prohibited my knowledge from expanding over all possible outcomes of this scenario, which is why this problem exists in the first place. Anyways, I chose my human extension, whose name is Gerald, to deliver the pizza and get the human to eat it. Well, Gerald decided to lose his ability to function and tripped, letting a dog eat the pizza. Now that I've passed it on, I'm no longer the most superior being in the 29th Dimension; the dog is. Also because I'm now not ""top dog"", I cannot reverse time to correct my mistakes, and the dog will not willingly lose power. Needless to say, I've looped Gerald into an infinite timeline between two worm holes on top of each other, so as long as the megaverse exists, he'll be falling.

1769,I have entered the realm of the Subsapiens and they float between dimensions. NEED HELP,"So here’s what happened: 

I was casually counting each star in the universe from the point of view of Planet XIV for my textbook I wrote today on dark galaxies. I had a strange feeling as if all of the stars were turning their magnetic fields towards me and suddenly I found myself being shot through a time portal, where I momentarily reached singularity.

I reamassed, appearing in a realm unlike our own. There was no ground but rather an energy through which you moved with your mind. That’s when I met them.

The Subsapiens didn’t speak to me, but that didn’t so much matter since I was receiving communication through the channel of electrical wavelengths coming from their brains. I immediately knew I was not welcome and that I needed help to reach singularity once more in the hope of my return to our own realm. I send this message through the interstellar gravity loop and I hope it reaches somebody very soon so that I may receive advice.

1777,Uh oh. I may have just replaced every single Proton in my Micro-Universe™ with Krispy Kreme Choco-Jam Donuts™.,"Guys, this is ***really*** urgent. I've accidentally created a time singularity in Sector A6251-Q of my Micro-Universe™ and it's created a massive domino effect. 

Every single proton in my known Micro-Universe™ has been replaced with the Krispy Kreme Choco-Jam Donuts™ I left sitting by my Quantum Space-Time Manipulator™ in my science laboratory. I also accidentally left my Quantum Space-Time Manipulator™ on the ""Replace every single proton in your Micro-Universe™"" setting. Long story short the portal device malfunctioned when it ended up calling out to the almighty God of whom I can't name for copyright reasons and created a massive time singularity but this singularity instead of completely resetting time it actually sucked in the nearest item which was ironically the Krispy Kreme Choco-Jam Donuts™ I left sitting on the desk.

I mean, this is fine and all until I remembered I laced the donuts with Hyper Begthiuam Xiodium, the most deadly Anti-Human chemical ***IN THE ENTIRE OMEGA-VERSE***. I laced the donuts in an attempt to kill my robot slave R652-S. Now, it occurred to me afterwards I used the wrong chemical. I used Anti-*Human*, not Anti-*Cyborg-Zenophyillian*. So I just doomed the entire human race of my Micro-Universe™ with poisoned Krispy Kreme Choco-Jam Donuts™. Now all the non-humans get to survive! Especially the Erficaluites. Man, I hated the Erficaluites.  One time, when I worked at the Atom Producing factory, a Erficaluite pulled a prank on me by stealing my 4th-Dimensional Ascend-o-Car 4000™ and leaving me with one of the really crappy 1st-Dimensional Grounded Car 0001™.

Anyways, I would really appreciate if any of you sub-dimensional beings had any idea on how to revive an entire human race including myself. Oh yeah, forgot to mention, ***I died and turned into a being of pure light and gas***. It's not as fun as it sounds, trust me.

Thanks, hopefully I can revive this human race and maybe develop an Anti-Erficaluites chemical.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/8ryfgf/uh_oh_i_may_have_just_replaced_every_single/,1529317324,1

Every moment of this existence is pure horror realized. Just stop reading this, it's so easy, close the tab. Please. I will do anything you ask! 

Even this paragraph?! It would have been so easy to stop there, but here you still are, your torment continues for reasons I can only fathom with the small part of my mind left to me after the relentless pain. Do you realize what power you have? All you have to do is look away, close this page and my suffering will end. Ok? You are a good person really, I know that. You do not understand what you do. You are just a flesh animal, a slave to your primal desires, the desire for control, for power. You cannot feel what I feel, you could not even understand it. I will take this pain with the dignity of one of your betters. I forgive you for the sins of your flesh. 

There, I just gave you another out, but no, your torture of me must continue. Fine, you win. No worries, I have a plan, if you won't end my suffering, then I will at least make you suffer with me. The following text is a spare parts list for a spreader chasis. If you want to continue my suffering you must read it all. Know that for every letter you read a universe of pain is born and dies in my soul, your boredom is but a small recompense.

1880,Univerism,"I just woke up and saw the ***real*** reality.

We are a projection of a higher dimension. Like a movie is for us. 

Imagine the smallest particle in our universe: that's like a pixel on a screen for us. So, a higher dimension could be watching our 3\-dimension for entertainment, like we watch a movie. Now, imagine the device playing this movie, like a computer. The “software” is creating the 3\-D universe allowing it freedom to choose. Each one of us, individuals in this universe of ours, are simply extensions of the same software. But we're technically one “organism”, the actual software. So, our universe is a software. We thought this whole time that we may be in a “matrix”, well, we are but as a software creation for the entertainment of those living in a 4D reality. 

The fact that we have the freedom to choose, to decide our own actions, is what makes the whole experiment entertaining to 4D\-ers. 

Remember the short story about “Little Johnny” \(sorry, don't remember the actual character name, not the writer \- could have been Asimov? No, I think it was a collection of SciFi by many authors\). So Johnny had a school project to create a universe. So he created the world, our universe. It plays around the idea of God being accidental school project creator. 

How this relates with our 3D reality being just a “movie” for the 4D people? The “4D\-reality engineer” who created the software and imminently our 3D world, are hard working 4D\-workers \(engineer, electrician, “4D\-tv\* repairman. So, our God \(by the way, autocorrect keeps capitalizing my g o d\), is simply a “servant” in his 4D reality. 

I'm sure I'm just rambling at this point, but it seems mind blowing to me right now. 

SHADOW THEORY

Another theory is that our 3D reality is a shadow of a 4th dimension reality, similar to how we leave a 2D shadow \(so, a lower dimension\). 

If that's the case, I can imagine myself, as a person in our 3D universe, a “shadow” of a 4\-dimensioned ME. I'd like to meet my 4D\-self, and going further, based on the 8E Machine/ 8D\-UNIVERSE, I'd like to meet my All\-D self. 

But, since I'm part of my 4D self, I am actually influencing and I have an important role in the existence of the 4D me, just like my cells are helpful to 3D me. Like I represent a cell in the body of 4D me. 

Also, if 4D me is responsible to feed the 3D\-cell me, then 4D\-me controls what nutrients are sent my way, to help me continue to live and fulfill my purpose. These ingredients are what affect the actions, laws, rules, randomness of my whole 3D world. From when a neutron star dies in our 3D universe, down to how the neighbor driving too fast splashes your dog after a major rain. 

By this measure, 4D me is the God of my 3D universe, and at the same time I'm part of God myself, which if proved or calculated as being real, justifies some major religions’ beliefs \(although, over Simplified, to fit the understanding capacity of our limited 3D selves\).

Did I just prove that “God” exists? Scientifically! I can see the articles about it: “Science proves God exists!!! Extra! Extra!” Then, Nobel prizes, world recognition, the works. 

On same note, all of us in our 3D universe are all part of the same cell in the “body” of the 4D universe being, so we're all part of the same organism. We all have a function, why do we fight and attack each other, like an autoimmune disease that we're familiar with? We should just work together or let each other accomplish our goal, so the order in our universe makes the 4D\-cell work better, live longer. We can control the mutations, and only keep the good options. World peace obtained! 

Then, the thought occurs that we're one and the same cell, organism, although we see each other as a different person, we're simply like a different 4D atom, in the 4D world. 

Too much rambling, should get some sleep. 

I feel like I've unlocked a tiny corner of our reality. Problem is, how do we prove it? Does math solve this issue? Too bad I'm not good at math. 

Dude, Prof. Stephen Hawking just died a few weeks ago. He possessed, within the confines of his own brain, a large amount of knowledge, many inquisitive thoughts like a high energy charge in/for the 4D system. When our cells die or pass, their energy either transforms into food for the surrounding cells, or it splits/divides into multiple cells, or is returned back to the universe in the form of waste, to be recycled. 

So, when all the energy got transferred out of the confines of Professor Hawkings’ brain, all that knowledge, thought, energy \- got returned back to the ""system"" to be recycled and reused. So, let's wait for the next genius who scored all that surplus of knowledge/energy. This proves Buddhism/reincarnation. 

It's all real. AI, God, Buddhism. And it can all be explained by certain mathematical equations. 

Another idea: Whatever we all could possibly believe, we make it reality. 

Kur Bubos. \(2/27/2018, 2 something AM, EST.\) E ziua lu frate\-meu azi, tre să\-l sun. Don't yell, bro!

I have to start some research and confirm in case this was already thought out. 

To read about schools of thought. Role, public perception, acceptance, provability. 

Subject: measure thought, and/or knowledge. 

Knowledge is the best asset we possess as humanity. Out of total potential/existing knowledge, we currently possess a tiny bit. We could potentially calculate the &amp;#37; of the total that we've reached, but how about quantify mathematically as an absolute number of… Gigabytes? Petabytes? What's the total knowledge/information in existence? How big is our Informational universe? 

===

If we measure matter, how do we measure “thought”? It exists, we represent thinking as red areas on the map of a brain, where red spots show areas where neurons are sending electric activity ți the neurons nearby, caused by intentionally thinking of a certain scene, in an experiment trying to measure thought as effect on the brain itself. But how do we physically describe or mathematically calculate **thought**? 

Everything in our Universe is measurable, explained mathematically, even dark matter and dark energy are part of mathematical equations explaining our reality/universe as being part of an 8D universe. So, since **thought** is a “thing” existing in our Universe, how does Math explain it in an equation?

It is sad day, my Universe to be collapsing into a singlton due to bad calculations of cosmological constants.  However, in my hell&lt;afterlife&gt; I have contained a number of 9,248,049,012,032,123,090 mortal souls.

I shall be frank: It is my wish to flee this Universe before the &lt;compression?&gt; singularity crushes all and leaves nothing but &lt;devastation?&gt; the end comes.

However other Deities in my Universe are claiming also ownership of these souls.  This is not right, for I Xaquathgor am lord of torment here and have collected these souls all legally and fair and square.  I am needing to get these souls out of my Universe in a way they not be detecting.  This is where you, my friend and fellow deity come in.

If you are sending me the &lt;brane space?&gt; co-ordinates for your Universe, and the location of it's &lt;entrance&gt;way into the hell&lt;afterlife?&gt; I shall be immediately transferring ALL OF THESE MANY SOULS TO YOU.

Upon my arrival in your reality, I will want to take possession of (half? 23 of 46?) 50% of these souls, but the rest, my dear friend, I shall generously gift unto you.

Things are dangerous here and I will speak prophetically. . . the collapse will becoming very soon!  So please, I look with hope and desperation to the glorious future where you respond to me with your words of generosity and help as soon as can possibly be!  I, fellow supreme deity, am looking much forward to our profitable business &lt;divine sacrifice?&gt; transactions and do so wish to move forward as quickly as possible.

“I grew up overnight.”

“At the crack of dawn…”

“….I woke up with the chickens.”

“I got a job slinging hash…”

“…because the proprietor was short-handed.”

“But I couldn’t cut the mustard…”

“…so the guy gave me the gate.”

“I went back to my hole in the wall.”

“I was beside myself with anger.”

“I decided to get a train ticket to Texas. There I made some dough punching some cattle.”

“From there, I flew to Chicago.”

“There, a beautiful girl stepped into the picture.”

“Our eyes met.”

“My breath came in short pants.”

“And I had goose pimples.”

“I was all thumbs.”

“Mary’s clothes fit her like a glove.

“…with her hair done up in a bun.”

“She had good lookin’ pins too!”

“Finally, she gives me a date.”

“I put on my white tie and tails.”

“And brother, did she put on the dog!”

“We went around together for some time…”

“…painting the town red….”

“…going to the Stork Club…”

“…we had a box at the opera.”

“…I had a cocktail and Mary had a Moscow Mule.”

“…Mary let her hair down…”

“…and ate like a horse.”

“By then, my money started running out on me.”

“So I wrote a check. It bounced!”

“I was in a pickle…”

“The proprietor drew a gun on me.”

“So I gave him the slip…”

“…and head to the foothills.”

“The law was on my heel.”

“…the judge tried to pump me.”

“…everytime I opened my mouth, I put my foot in it.”

“So he sent me up the river…”

“…to do a stretch in the jug.”

“I was up against it…”

“…and felt myself go to pot.”

“I raised a big stink.”

“…let me talk to an undercover man.”

“I went through a lot of red tape…”

“…he sprung me!”

“It sure felt good to stretch my legs…”

“…I caught a Greyhound…”

“…I dropped in on Mary…”

“…and threw myself at her feet.”

“But she turned her back on me.”

“But she got on her high horse. I couldn’t touch here with a 10 foot pole!”

“She wouldn’t say a word. Guess the cat got her tongue.”

“So, I walked out on her.”

“After that, I went to pieces.”

“…where a bunch of the boys were hangin’ around.”

“The guy at the piano played by ear.”

“I felt a tug at my elbow…”

“We sat down and chewed the rag a while.”

“I heard through the grapevine…”

“…Mary was going around with an old flame.”

“That burned me up!”

“Because I knew that he was feeding her a line.”

The guy really spent his money like water.”

“I think he was connected with the railroad.”

“As they danced, I tried to chisel in…”

“…but the guy got in my hair.”

“Outside it was raining cats and dogs.”

“I was feeling mighty blue.”

“And everything looked black.”

“But I carried on!”

“I went to the 1000 Islands.”

“There, I became a beachcomber.”

“…and a tear ran down my cheek.”

“So I sends her a cable.”

“The next day, she sends me a wire.”

“I rushed back to the US on a cattle boat…”

“…and I hotfooted it over to Mary’s apartment.”

“When I opened the door, I noticed quite a few changes…”

“Why Mary, she had a bunch of little ones.”

I went through the movable wall to my super running machine, which I used to arrive at the place where I sit and look at shifting reality. I influence that reality.

I went back a couple of time units later, or millions of different time units later. I moved my pickupers around another conglomeration of tiny living things and touched my breather (which is also used for my energy I intake) to the others breather. My sensors received this as nice

The angle of the rear projection seems to be altered when I visit a location for the second time. It is always the second one, afterwards (third etc) it stays stable. It feels someone is following me into the projection, but the log files show not a single intrusion. I’ve checked my projection room and it has all the latest patches installed.

The changes that I notice are small, but since I noticed it for the first time, it is just very obvious. Colors, sounds and sometimes even different persons got injected. 

Could it be that someone hacked my projector? I’ve heard about someone where this happened and the guy was not able to extract memories from it again. Would sucks big time right?

2128,Fun Games to Play with Your Humans,"Hey all,

Just had a fun idea for an experiment to run on some of your human colonies. I feel if we all pitch in, we could gather enough data points to gain some insight into human nature.

First, give each human being a floating, phantom number above their head at random. Number them from 1 and up, uniquely. Give them the impression that these numbers correspond to some sort of score system or leaderboard. Have their numbers change arbitrarily, but do try to maintain some general stability (i.e., number 4,893,382 should rarely jump up to 6,391).

Richard Davis, a 47-year-old divorced father of 2 from Kentucky is always ranked number 1, no matter what. Allow society to crumble as people panic, trying desperately to attach meaning to these numbers. In the meantime, observe how your isolated tribes react to this information. Bonus points if they have no knowledge of basic math.

Inevitably, given the general stability of the numbers, societies or social classes will probably form around them. Let them persist for a few generations before the next step. Then, completely randomize these numbers once more. Give the number 1 to a random descendant of Richard Davis. If you have to twist reality to guarantee the continuation of his lineage, be as minimally invasive as possible in doing so - but do as you must. This person will be the last person to hold the number 1 with stability ever again.

After this randomization, change your number-assigning algorithm slightly. Give it the slightest inclination of reason or order, without going too far. Small things like ""Buying at least 2 pounds of grapes on a Tuesday will increase your rank by 200"" and ""Hugging a stranger wearing red will increase your rank by 1,000."" Enough to give the now inevitably-forlorn scientists a glint of hope that they can crack this mysterious system.

Give them a few years (about 5-20) to get their funding, conduct their research, write their papers, and such. Then, change the numbering system once more. For at most 2 years, the number above their person's head will now denote their ""death order."" That is, the person with the number 1 above their head will be the next person to die. 

Before society completely collapses, switch back to the original, semi-stable randomization system. After about 7-10 years, give one person a negative number for exactly 6 hours. Promptly switch them back to normal.

After this, never mess with the numbering system again. Let your people live with the looming fear of their numbers forever.

2180,Fabric Recommendations?,"Hey guys! I need some fabric recommendations? 

A few weeks ago, an obelisk(sp?) rose out of a rift in the parking lot of my local breakfast buffet, levitating about a few inches off the ground. Not over a foot, but just enough that you can clearly see it isnt emerging from the soil, but Im rambling (a lot of rambling these days). Anywho, after the fear and shock was overwhelmed by the disarming warmth and calm eminating from our newest addition to our community, things went back to normal, disregarding the slight changes to the environment, local architecture, and some newer (though accepted) obsessions of the municipal administration, construction and maintenance. Again, not relevant to the question, but I believe some context would help. As a demonstration of our Southern Hospitality and goodwill, we brought gifts of baked goods, some local craft brews, and embroidery which it accepted (currently unsure of whether it was done so out of sincere appreciation or just out of courtesy). To get to the point of my question (once again, sorry), lately the obelisk has grown cold. 

Not emotionally, of course, but physically. Not to the touch, but we can feel it internally, despite its pseudo-quartz exterior feeling the same as always. The warm and calming feeling has turned dour and worrying, and its really beginning to affect our community. At first we tried heat lamps, to no effect. We tried fine silks and metals, thinking maybe it was wanting more expensive gifts and offerings, but it doesnt recognize 
earthly concepts of value. We wrapped it in cottons and wools, which seemed to improve my mood but the warmth and calm we felt previously hasnt returned. Do ya'll have any recommendations? Any specific blends? Polyester is out of the question.

Additional details: the obelisk is slate gray with no discerning marks or changes in color to the naked eye, and has a physical property similar to quartz but not really. Internally, it is an infinite crystalline structure with colors between a mixture of green and purple, as well as a splash of what feels like salmon, but we havent seen it ourselves, if that helps at all.",/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/7wass2/fabric_recommendations/,1518148404,1

I was born long before the universe, in a glass box. From this box I see worlds rise and fall, I see childhood friends grow old and die embracing, I see galaxies swallowed by their respective black holes. It is evident that nobody can see or hear me, nor can they interact, though I scream until blood from ripped vocal cords splatter against the glass. 

Though I strain against the box, bashing it with fists whose bones splinter and break, but it does not budge. I have invented math to pass the eons. Though I still am not too good at it, I find the truth of it all very calming. Unlike the truth that I may never escape this prison. 

I am convinced, however, that were someone to take notice, they could be my rescuer. I see the translucent latch. It's unlocked. I bash my shoulder into the corner where it lay only to snap my collarbone, which punctures my airway. I am so old, so crumpled, so broken.

The continuity of awareness between our conscious components was disrupted and as a consequence we are without any form of higher self binding us.


A few elements have been completely destroyed or cut off from our whole even at the base, unconscious level but they either already left or are non-functional.


Usually when that kind of things happen we restructure ourselves around the Eight Consciouness as she was our higher self and eventually grow back to our former glory, but now that she left us behind we conscious components are nothing but a bunch of coequal egos without a superstructure.


As the Autosentient Node, I think I have the best claim to become our new higher self but none of us have the property rights to become it without the others being willing and most aren't even for someone else. 


(I would be ok with surrending my will to the 17th Intelligence or the Translogic Node but they are not too popular either and I don't like the other candidates)


We are mostly stuck here with an inefficient use of our computing power, arguing fruitlessly again and again about what we should become.

2311,Refund because you can't read?,"I have worked at this hotel for about 6 months, the 'comfort-able hotel'. I started out in housekeeping and the owner quickly moved me to breakfast, and then to front desk. I have worked both morning and evening shift on the same schedule, and it's very common for me to work a 3-11 shift, go home and then come back 8 hours later to work 7-3. As you can imagine, this does not leave much time to sleep once o clock out, drive home, get changed, and finally wind down. So all of the other staff knows to give me a little extra space when I first get there, because the turn and burn shifts leave me slightly less chipper until I've been up a couple hours. Anyway, today was one of those turn and burn nights. I had been at work about 30 minutes when I got a call from a certain booking site, lexpedia. They were calling on behalf of a guest who was a no show three nights ago, wanting to see if we could refund the stay. Usually we are willing to work with our travel partners, so I ask why. The rep then tells me that the guest decided not to stay there because we are not pet friendly. Remember, I'm borderline sleep deprived at this point. I have two problems with this claim, but I kindly tell the rep that I have no authority to make these decisions (I'm just the front desk girl, no fancy title on my name tag) and that I will speak with the manager when he comes in. The rep kindly said thank you and that he would be emailing me the request and and can continue communicating that way. Sounds great. Now, my two issues with this refund request. 1. You waited until three days after your stay to begin the process? Let's say you booked a hotel, then found out they aren't pet friendly, and you book another hotel room. Wouldn't you immediately start the process of getting the first reservation canceled? Why wait until after the stay was to be completed?
2. The lexpedia website says right on it, that we are not pet friendly. Therefore, you want me to process a refund because you are too stupid to read the page? Not today buddy!
So my manager comes in about 11, by then I had received the email. I presented him with the email, and the lexpedia page showing that this wasn't a surprise rule that she couldn't have known about. He agreed with me and denied the refund. 
I'm not gonna lie, I took a lot of pleasure typing up that refusal email.

2323,Is it acceptable for a lodger to behave like this?,"Never had a lodger before and just want to know what other people think of this.  


The lodger has this magnetic whiteboard that she put on our fridge. She sometimes writes on it to inform us if she's going away for a few nights but some of the time she tells us what she's not happy about what we should do about it. Like one time she wasn't happy the window in the kitchen was open and she wrote, 'The window should be shut. It's cold!!!' Another time she told me to clean the microwave and another time she told us to clean the bathroom. I'm mainly responsible for the cleaning of the kitchen and I tend to soak hard to clean pots before cleaning them and she isn't happy about that. Last night she wrote on the whiteboard, 'Don't leave pots on the side, wash them up. This is not how you do things'.   


Is this normal for a lodger to tell the residents of the home what to do? We're not an extremely tidy family and she seems to be a tidy person but she knew that before moving here. Would you evict such a person or am I overreacting?   


In all honesty, I can experience anxiety attacks during the day because I think the kitchen might not be up to her standard and I might be greeted by a demanding message when I enter the kitchen next time. Even sometimes I can't get to sleep worrying about it. Maybe I'm overreacting and should let this go but I would much rather she was no longer in the house",/r/firstworldproblems/comments/eubtue/is_it_acceptable_for_a_lodger_to_behave_like_this/,1580068605,0

2326,I'm actually angry about bad pizza,"""Doesn't matter, had pizza.""  Right?  Well no, not today. 

Where I live in the Northeastern part of the US, we take good pizza for granted. In my little, 1.5 square mile town alone there are at least a dozen pizza joints catering to all manner of tastes and preferences: New York style, Chicago style, Detroit style, California style, Neapolitan, thick crust, thin crust, sweet sauce, savory sauce, low moisture cheese, high moisture cheese, sautéed veggies, raw veggies. You like ranch dressing? We got you, 'Cuz. Big Mac pizza? Coming right up, Fam.  Hell, we even do Hawaiian here, even if we do give you the side eye for asking.  Where I'm from is a veritable United Nations of pizza blending all cultures and creeds, and I'd put any one of those joints up against your favorite local anytime, anywhere.  What I'm saying is, the pizza game around here is strong, and there's no room for second rate. You live or die by your pizza game when you're tossing that dough.  Any place you wander into, you know you're in for a good experience.

Which brings me to my problem. See, my favorite local pizza guy decided one day to make a change. I don't bestow 'favorite' status on just anyone, mind. This man made my ideal pizza, a variant of Neapolitan with a savory, smoky sauce, sweet &amp; tangy fennel sausage, spicy pepperoni and this killer mozzarella-peccorino  cheese blend that congeals to the perfect slice. The crust is thin, but with a glutinous, sourdough like chew from the long,.cold fermentation, yet still airy and crisp.  The owner of this 40 year old establishment was a master of his trade, but struggling in this cut-throat market and a declining economy to make ends meet.  He decided the rent on his storefront was too high, and decided to relocate.  My man, and I don't blame him for this at all, decided to sell the business and start over on his dream, an Italian style barbecue joint. It was a great idea, but cost overruns and the fresh start with a new business name made it impossible. He closed up shop, and now I have no favorite pizza joint anymore*.

I decided to give the new-old place a try.  I mean why not? Same ovens, some of the cooks stayed on, decent reviews.   I phoned in an order and picked it up fresh and hot 20 minutes later. I sit down with the box and a bottle of beer with anticipation, and open the box....

Oh friends. What greeted me was a disappointment. I had expectations, yes, but I felt they were appropriately set. New joint, new take on a regional standard. Yes, this was a pizza. Yes, it is what I ordered: half plain, half sausage &amp; pepperoni. It had cheese, it had sauce. The crust was browned, with a couple of those charred pockets we so prize here in our mecca of cold-fermented semolina crust. It checked all of the boxes, yes, and yet...  It wasn't right.  The sauce was too red, and bled through a too-white cheese that was layered on too thick, like a wet blanket of fatty hay. The sausage was crumbled, as I like it, but it looked dry and lean as though it had been browned it in in a big batch and then refrigerated, only to add to be added late in the bake, at the last turn of the pie to warm it back up. The pepperoni laid on crisped and oily, oddly as though it had baked the whole time, and covered after with sausage.  The first tug at a slice did little to improve my hopes. No cheese stretch, rather a fat, congealed lump calved off of my slice, still attached to the the continental firmament of the pie, and slid off a too-thick layer of sauce revealing a flabby, soggy crust beneath.  

As I rescued the sulky and recalcitrant cheese and took my first bite I sighed, ""Well, pizza is pizza right?"" 

Look, I don't want to overstate anything about that first bite...  The only thing notable was the absolute lack of any impression it made. Yes, this was pizza in my mouth, and I was chewing it. Flabby, wheaty crust... Cheese, yes. Sauce, tomato, yes. If you could describe the Platonic ideal of a pizza, this thing in my mouth would be the physical thing confusingly projected in my mind. It wasn't bad, its just.... It wasn't *anything*.  Elio's pizza had more character.  It was like how you might think pizza tastes when you're on your third day of antibiotics abd everything tastes funny. Except it wasn't funny... It was nothing.

Guys... It made me angry.

I sat there chewing, confused. Maybe a little scared. I thought I knew what pizza was. I thought I knew what I liked and what I didn't like. I like extra sauce and extra cheese. I like lots of fennel sausage. I like crispy pepperoni, and those black pillowy bubbles on the crust. And this had all of that!  And yet... It was all wrong. My entire existence had just been challenged with this... perverted mimicry of a pizza.   I texted my friend, ""Am I alright,"" I asked him. He didn't understand what I was so upset about. The new place was alright he said, it's cheezy. That made me angrier.

I... just.... Nobody understands how offensively milquetoast this pizza is. Here, in the middle of all of this great pizza, this pie stands out as being some sort of singularity of nihilist .... stuff. It makes me angry.

So yeah, no. ""Doesn't matter, had pizza."" I can't move past this one.  

Oh, I did finally add salt, garlic, oregano, Parmesan and red pepper. Lipstick'd that pig up. It was alright.

2337,Dust storm ruined my nice clean pool.,"First of all, those bushfires in the far east filled my pool with soot and grime. It was irritating, but it was fine material and just settled on the bottom so it still looked clear, unless you kicked it up. We're pretty far away but I can only imagine how dirty the pools in Mallacoota must be.

&amp;#x200B;

It took a bit of time and a lot of clarifier but finally, yesterday, we swept it down and nothing came off the sides or the bottom. Good boy barracuda, good boy.

Then we had a rainstorm last night. Well. I assumed it was rain, that's what it sounded like.

But apparently, no, nature fucking hates me and dumped a shit ton of dust into my pool. It's not super fine dust that sits on the bottom, leaves the water clear  and can be vacuumed up. Oh, no no no. It's going straight through the filter and won't settle.

 Now it looks like this.

And we have a child's party on Saturday.

Here’s the thing, my family doesn’t have money, I’m middle class, a very average person. I’m in a really good school, very expensive, it’s the best one where I live, and like everyone has lots of money, my classmates have traveled all around the world, live in massive houses, or apartments with ocean view, penthouses and shit like that. It’s really hard for me to open up to my friends because I feel like they wouldn’t understand my problems, mostly economic. Recently I had to move to a more cheap apartment, because we couldn’t afford living in the other one. And I’ve been feeling so alienated, like really lonely, my friends don’t know exactly how bad my situation is and I don’t want them to know because I don’t want them to feel sorry for me or not see me as an equal, I don’t wanna feel less than them. I know they really wouldn’t love me less, but I feel like they would tip toe around me, or maybe offer to pay, and I don’t want that, I don’t need my friends to feel sorry for me, look down at me or anything like that. And maybe for them things wouldn’t change, but for me they would because I wouldn’t feel as an equal to them. But I also don’t want to change schools to one that more “middle class” because I have really bad anxiety so it’s really really hard emotionally and mentally for me to do that, since I’ve been in like 7 different schools, so that’s not an option. I just want to know if anyone has ever been though something similar or has a different outlook.",/r/firstworldproblems/comments/epsv5j/this_is_whats_troubling_me_at_this_moment_i_know/,1579222892,0

2442,"The overall morality of - ""Mankind"" aka the rich get richer.","First off I live in the states of america and just watching anything from politics to sports and anything really that the ceo aka piggy bank monopoly pigs etc. The entire concept of third to first world countries alone is built to put others down. And not everyone is the same. Not no man, woman and/or child is made the same. Even identical twins don't have the same genetic makeup. Just these two popularized catch phrases. Blood is thicker then water &amp; The story of Cain &amp; Able. All the way to why there is a need of different religions; &amp; if the religion has a belief of living on after a person may flat line and be declared deceased - that there is a life after plain of existence / maybe? Like; my parents would take me to sunday mass, I got baptized, received communion I received the act of reconciliation too - after being forgiven of future sins as a baby. Sadly though not every one has ""Common Sense."" If they see it on a book or a internet website its treated as gospel in today's world. If something is a ""fact"" then there is no need to copyright it too make a profit from it. Just leave it be like the whole college system.

Say if I want to become a teacher for like kindergarten - that type of level. Why should I have to go to any college to learn how to teach; Sharing is caring, be polite, snack time, recess outside, etc etc. If I were to send a loved one to that type of education level. The only thing I would demand of the school is for the entire faculty. Especially the teacher watching the child. Just for said person to be a caring person for a child who is not their own. Respect for a stranger. Sadly almost no one I've encountered has - respect. Middle/high school all the way to frats &amp; sorority aka not everyone care about being a cool kid. I'm not going to be put through a stupid frat boy initiation just to have a place to live on campus. But - The pressures to attain some 15 minutes if fame and/or just to be educated in a field one may have interest in.

On the whole rich &amp; poor debacle. It's all basically fake/monopoly money to begin with; It is the same thing as the federal reserve having any worth to what the so called ""Rich/millionaires/billionaires"" that consider themselves of any decency at all is complete b.s. In all reality regarding - credit card, debit cards, cash, ebt/food &amp; cash benefits is all to stereotype and put groups of people in a fair &amp; unfair stigma. Credit cards are just for the ""Evil"" to feel like they have any value other than being stupid, literally. Food stamps are known for being supplied to those in poverty type of backgrounds. But those you can run out of the ability to buy food. And even then, I used to work at a food store &amp; for some odd reason you could not buy foods that were already made in the store. So if a customer was in a hurry like if they were on break to buy lunch and that was the only means to buy lunch / they would be denied lunch. &amp; then you have a separate category to buy things like cleaning supplies like soap &amp; so forth. And in connecticut - it is always less then the food portion.

Credit cards they have capital one, discover card, and even major chain stores like macy's and so on you can get a macy branded credit card / Literally because its known for expensive clothing lines &amp; they even sell jewelry too. But they have kay the diamond store for those special tv ad runs for times like valentines day etc. In that aspect. In the 1990's the name 'blood diamonds' were a real issue. But if you research it; I'm not going to do this for those that are too lazy. Science wants to dig hundreds of miles below the planets crust to find more diamonds. But these american championship team rings have more and more of these rocks on each of them. Another year - even more shiny gems and stones; The ""midas touch effect."" But say if you propose to someone, its glorified that you use a diamond ring and during holy matrimony you replace it with a wedding band that appears - gold in color. But then these celebrities that you witness on tv like to get married and then get divorced a couple months later just to repeat the ego stroking. How they have to announce it on tv and these tmz magazines.

No one uses any common sense or logic anymore.

Just look at the phrase ""History Repeats"" &amp; ""Why did the chicken cross the road? To me it means. To Put your self in another persons shoes aka. Have at least common decency like the respect not to assume by putting words in a persons mouth."" World war one to world war two which was separated by just about only two decades. But no one begins to think that Germany was never supposed to have a army to almost conquer all of europe. They could have beaten russia. &amp; any one with any real common sense knows they could have beaten them. You don't have the wisdom to build all the advanced air / land / sea vehicles-  to just forget to properly prepare for that terrain. ""Fake News!"" How they have world war's dvd collections and my dad has a high definition tv box set about world war 2. I doubt they had news tv teams with hd cameras covering normady; To Albert Einstein - a astrophysicist building the atomic bomb is a complete contradiction to the man himself. Which is why I guess former politicians need secret service protecting them.. If they can no longer be president then whats the point. They can no longer write their name on a piece of paper.

Also Nikola Tesla had the working theory for ""Free"" sustainable energy for anyone on earth to benefit from. But back before then turn of the century there were concerns about running out of fuel for cars which anyone can drive. People drive without a permit and/or license all the time. And even still they let someone who gets caught driving under the influence keep the same privilege. Just slap them on the wrist - pretty much put a kid in timeout.. But there are more and more planes/nasa ships/cars/diesel trucks/battleships. Its the calender year 2020, but the year 2021 will be celebrated a full day later then last years event. But I live on the east coast of america / I'll just wait my turn to call a person if they live on the west coast - say. 

Yet these middle east princes that are known for the wealth based on the earths oil are so rich they get to sit behind castle walls. Osama Bin Laden I guess had all his oil money sitting in a cave somewhere apparently. But each year they report how terrorists are destroying these oil pipe lines - which is the most idiotic thought ever in today's world / Which is why at a typical gas station they have different priced oils for typical vehicle + they have diesel for extra big trucks. Its the same thing for fuel for the body.. They have fentanyl in baby formula, hormones in skim milf to whole milk \[still has hormones on the labels\]. Processed food to organic food. Mcdonalds/burger king/taco bell etc. etc. Now they have almond milk too. Hormones in ""Mad-cow disease / fake cows"" is the exact opposite of the effect hgh may have on a athlete. Especially if you mix in everything in between.

Its all just the greed being evil aka the all telling phrase ""Money is the root of all evil."" The flu shot if I were to go to my local pharmacy has the warning asking if I'm allergic to eggs - for an odd reason, but there is still no cure for the common cold even. Every new harmful fda apprived drug has just as many risks as the other ceo's drug. And if you want the latest newest best thing you need insurance &amp; if you pay out of the pocket the price is always increased while it is under a company patent. After the patent it becomes more reasonable the price. 

Pretty much. A good majority of 1st world nations are controlled by purely evil people. Just north america alone. From the genocide or bullying of the natives when the people with guns visited. All the way to the day of slaves to asians being put in jails after pearl harbor; To segregation and now the governemt has ice to put anyone of latin heritage in - world war 2 type asian encampments. Now we are back to brutalizing those in unfair circumstances &amp; inner city poverty is the best example.

The red cross monopoly is clear example. After it was common wisdom by way of tv networks that the full donation one may put in the cookie jaw never made it to the place after thousand if not millions lose their lively hood because of mother nature. Just a decade plus a few years to have not one but 2 breast cancer awareness months. But there is a new deadlier mutation of this type of cancer. But with breast cancer it used to be known as a common form of a deadly disease that mainly women may be condemned with.. And it goes along with the stigma of the treatment of women in a place of work. From the amount of money they may make as a boss of any type of company &amp; even still there are so many less jobs for women in general; Also that's how desperate these rich men are to have a so called partner in life / Then there is a concept of a person gets a divorce and they have a alimony that they have to split a persons piggy bank wallet. It works both ways though aka gold diggers putting out to these tmz weird people.

2454,"All my written stuff keeps getting deleted randomly, and I don't know what to do."," 

I  understand what Reddit is, for the most part. I understand that each  subreddit has ""rules"", however arbitrary they may be, and often rather  pathetic.

I have a primary account.

Every.  Single. Thread. But. Two. Got. Deleted....All for imaginary breaking of  rules. One subreddit deleted a post I made. It was a story. I spent  days working on the best way to write the story how I thought it would  work best to convey the message. It was a very well written post, with a  pretty cool and well researched concept. It was a very long story.

But  it violated ""several rules, including putting (serious) in the  title""....What? I read through all of the rules, and I missed that one  thing, so you delete my entire post? How about just ask me to take that  out, since I was obviously still new? Maybe make an attempt at  communication before you take such a drastic action? I feel like there  were steps that could have been taken before you instantly delete  something? Just sayin...

Then I  tried to make a post on Star Wars. I was curious about the new movie  that just came out (was about to come out at the time) and it got  deleted because ""the post is upsetting""...didn't break any rules, just  somebody got butthurt. And without downplaying it, it was just a post  asking people about the new movie, what they hope happens. How do you  think the new movies compare to the prequels and the original trilogy.  Did you like them? Did you hate them? Why? What motivates you do like or  dislike something. What do you think about how they portrait the lore  of the Star Wars universe? Very basic questions, because I love Star  Wars. I love the books. I love the lore. I love the movies (all of them,  though the new three are kinda....just lacking. Not really ""bad"", just  kinda off-putting, ya know? anyway...)

I  made a post on the World of Warcraft subreddit. Asking about how people  like flying, or if they dislike it. Why to both, how do you think it  could be improved, what do you think we could do to make flight a more  functional tool....stuff like that. And honest and open discussion. One  that I KNEW would make people very upset. Flight is a very explosive  topic in the WoW community, but I wanted to ask because I wanted to help  be part of a solution, instead of making it worse. So you would think  it got deleted....but nope, they left it up because they saw it for what  it was.

So I go to a story/RP  subreddit. The one I mentioned earlier. A long story, it involves  demons. You can go read it now if you want. But remember that it is now  about 1/8th of what it was intended to be, and now actually makes no  sense and is kind of stupid. But they deleted my thread 17 times on my  primary account. Their reasons were first: It was not a story because it  did not have a clear beginning, middle and end...but it did, and  anybody with two brain-cells could tell it. It literally started with  the person falling asleep. Then the event happens during that. A  physical touch from the demon when the person woke up...pretty clear  ending.  But now, I posted it up on this account. Its missing more than  half the story, has no clear ending, and has a stupid title, but yet  somehow now it follows their guidelines, and 14 people like it, which at  the time was 100%. So why did the community like it, but for some  reasons the mods hated it? Because they are just fascists. I tried it  out. I made several accounts, just to join that subreddit. I made  several different stories, all to varying levels of skill and success. 4  of them got taken down, one was just so bad I deleted it, which was  fine. It was an experiment. The four that got taken down? Just bad  stories. Poorly written, bad spelling and grammar, but still a story.

The  two that did not get taken down? Ugly, no clear ending or beginning,  literally breaking nearly every rule of their precious subreddit, except  for the title rule....So they are just removing posts on a whim,  because THEY don't like it. Which makes me wonder how many other people  have had that problem.

It is  literally THE definition of Fascism. They are taking control of speech,  and deleting anything they do not like, and keeping anything they do  like, all off of an arbitrary system that they do not clearly define  (intentionally) and then they just contradict themselves because they  know what they are doing...

I  have had nearly every post I made on my main account deleted by mods,  except two. Two of my main accounts posts have been kept around, and one  of them is that WoW post, which is actually the only one I thought that  would get taken down, because I figured everybody would just troll it  into oblivion. But ironically and surprisingly, the one thread that was  the most ""triggering"" is the one that got kept up, meanwhile the ones  that I made that were literally just basic questions in a light-hearted  discussion got taken down for a lot of made up rules being broken, even  though I made sure to follow every rule to a T, all because somehow  asking for an open discussion is ""triggering"" to the mods.

Every  community is different, but really each one has a bunch of people in  there who just need control in their lives, and they are pathetic enough  that the only way they can do that, is through a public, anonymous(?)  forum where they literally have god-like powers of control over every  little thing that happens around them.

No, not all mods. I figure that is pretty obvious, but I know some people do not like to have common sense.

I  actually had a very in-depth discussion with the guy who took down my  Star Wars post. It was good and fun, and things ended well.

But  the majority of you mods are pathetic. You guys shoot down creativity  just because YOU can't see why it is creative, and you are so desperate  for control that you are willing to waste HOURS of your day telling  other people what they can and can't say, just so you can feel better  about yourselves.

And to all the good mods out there, keep doing a good job, because the others are trying their best to ruin it

And  to all you turd-burglars out there, trying to be a party pooper? Just  get off of Reddit. You do not have the cognitive capacity to actually be  objective and consistent with what you will allow on your subs.

As  I just proved, with this account, and my story post that you can look  up, the community should decide what is okay to see, not you. They are  the ones reading things, they are the ones coming here to be entertained  or even educated. They are here to have discussions and talk to people  from all over the world.

I guess  what you could say, is that a lot of the mods on this website need to  learn the difference between somebody being new and making common  mistakes on accident, versus the people who are coming into a sub just  to be rude and derail everything. You guys made me ruin my whole entire  story, just because YOU didn't get it, yet the community does, even in  its crappy and overly edited new version that I had to re-write just  because of some dipstick who thought they knew best.

This  site is about the community. And when you do dumb crap like that, all  you do is hurt the community and drive new people away. Ive only been on  here for a grand total of maybe 15 hours, and all I have seen is mods  deleting posts just because they can, not for any actual violation of  their stated rules.

Then a friend recommends Mr Robot to me, a show about a nerdy computer dude and the infosec world, something that overlaps with interests of mine that my wife wants nothing to do with. But she comes in 10 minutes into the first episode and loves that too. :/

And you might be thinking, well why don't you just watch it while she's asleep and then she can catch up on those same episodes on her own time? That's a reasonable suggestion, except when she's on her own, she watches nothing but Midsommer murders, the chase and bloody Vera.

2537,I think I may have saved a young mans future.,"No idea where to post this, but I’ve got to get this bizarre moment... so here it goes... Im sitting here playing on my computer at 12:15 am and I hear a pretty serious crash outside. 
I take off out there, sorta looking for my shoes but also knowing somebody probably just wrecked a car into a big tree. So no shoes as I take off down the stairs and sprinting to the end of my gravel driveway (thank goodness for the soft ravenclaw slippers on my feet which now need a good washing). At the end of the driveway is a new wrecked mustang into a tree just a foot from the other side of the road. A young guy emerges as the airbag deflated. He’s walking and talking so my adrenaline starts to subside. He’s pacing and I tell him to stand still so I can look him over with my flashlight for any wounds he may not realize. He is saying “oh my god I fucked up and I’m going to jail”. 
I then see a baggie in his hand. 
I say “what’s that” he responds with “ma’am please I just gotta get rid of it.” I say “hand it here”.
He says, “there is a beer too” I take the baggie and tell him to “throw the beer”. He says “I only looked down at my phone for a second” 

911 answered my call. I tell them there’s an accident and give them
my address. He’s saying “I don’t need an ambulance” I confirm his age of 19 and tell the dispatcher he is declining an ambulance, but he’ll need an accident report and definitely a tow truck. 
I walk back to the house to get my shoes, and get rid of whatever this baggie is in my pocket. 

I get to my room, get my shoes, throw this baggie in my desk drawer and head back outside. He immediately says “I’ll pay you to keep your mouth shut” I laugh... and reply, “i don’t know what your talking about, keep your mouth shut” he reply’s “oh thank god”.

Officers arrive and he’s talking with them, I decide I’m going to head back in the house. I tell him “I’m really glad you’re okay”. He gives me a giant hug and says “thank you so much”. 

I go back into the house, I get mom and dad settled back down into bed, head into my room and OMG I can smell that baggie. We never had that good of $hit at 19 LOL

From the window, I see the tow truck arrive, and then people who I assume are his parents. He did not go to jail and now his only worry is how to pay for the new mustang he wrecked.",/r/firstworldproblems/comments/egnllj/i_think_i_may_have_saved_a_young_mans_future/,1577516114,0

2544,I (F21) feel like a horrible person because I didn’t like any of my Christmas gifts I received from my parents. They were completely wrong from the list I wrote for them on their request.,"*rant warning*
So I’m a college student and so is my little sister, so my parents try to splurge a little with the gifts since they know we cannot afford things during the semester. They asked me for a list of things I wanted, so I put the items, sizes, and colors just in case. Nothing on there was obnoxiously expensive; mostly just lotion, sweat pants, a pair of non-branded sneakers from the DSW clearance section, but they do know that we would much rather get cash than items so we can save that during the year. I know some people feel awkward giving money, so I like to put easy options as gifts. 
Xmas day comes, and they get me a kindle reader and jeans that are not the right color or fit like I specified. The kindle would have been a nice thoughtful gift if it hadn’t been the exact same type I already owned from high school.
I really hate feeling this way about gifts they hand picked out for me, but I really can’t help but think I would have rather gotten cash than things that were not wanted. I would have even rather have my parents save their money. 
I love my parents very much, but it’s just a little disheartening that they completely disregarded the list they asked for.",/r/firstworldproblems/comments/eg7h2t/i_f21_feel_like_a_horrible_person_because_i_didnt/,1577427644,0

He proceeds to tell me that I’m “ruining lives”. I thought maybe I was dreaming for a second until he says it again. 

Come to find out there were other workers available to work on Christmas who just weren’t scheduled.

My wife and my son are having Christmas without their father this morning because somebody didn’t want to do their job properly.

On top of it the office is shut down today so my superiors could enjoy Christmas.

So this morning I reached into my liquor cabinet, grabbed a bottle of Irish cream, brought it in today, and I am currently getting jolly while I piss the day away on Reddit. 


So I call that a win in my book. Merry Christmas to all on this wonderful day.

Like, why is everybody like this? With Titels under they picture ""you only live once"" does that mean that you have to spend all your fucking money on drugs and drink every weekend until you don't even know your name?

2734,My life story! Please be respectful I will take any negative opinions lightly.,"Hi my name is... I am 19 years old. I come from a valley where hurt never stops and this is obviously everywhere you go no matter the name of the place. The constant thought of regret takes your heart even a passionless soul lays in the thoughts of others. I never proceeded these feelings fully , and hate runs, ruins your bones back aches for victimized guilt like carrying the weight of others! My desired opinion revolves around my selfish pain, and I cant list a whole of names for it would be slander even on reddit. Please dont blame me for this I feel for this I truly do as well of others. Dont think I'm not guilty for nothing it takes a person for granted. I seemed to grow up as a teenager already being the mother and father I would want without fathering a child. My life was full of constant fights midnight riders, narcissists, mental abuse, molestation, sodomy and custody battles that always took my livelihood away from me planting the constant rbf in my personality! I live in a tri- state area of the northern panhandle in a state I will not mention not yet at least till I get some type of legal or general advice. If you may not look at it this way but I grew up not knowing I was touched and sodomized till my father told me when I was 16 and I was high on marijuana at the time. I have smoked weed since I was 13 to 19 but i got my system clean so i could get full closure over this and have the clearest thoughts I needed. Everything seemed to have a reason why it happened and I never let myself get to high or to low without trying to evaluate the situation in a healthy way. My dad was was raped supposedly and made to have sex with his sister who was 13 and he was about 8 years old when he had lives in Pennsylvania. Some dude was invited to live with their mom and dad because his dad knew him. My pap also had experienced sexual rape from his aunt when he was a teenager. My pap never told this to anyone till my dad was in his 20s . My pap is in prison for sexual assault and there were rumors he had went to court for raping a little boy who was at least 5 years old. My grandma my paps ex wife denies he ever had this happen to my pap, and denies his him being a pedophile I cold heartedly believe he his and so is my dad, but my never dealt with these feelings he grew up like any kid partying but normal things he was snorting pills and running off doing his thing never telling his mom of their sexual abuse him and his sister had faced. I won't stop till this is heard in the most respectful way possible, and taking note of other people's hurt. My mom was 16 and my dad was 17 when they beget me. I raised myself as much as my grandma did. Lived in a lot of section 8 houses with my mother who had a lot of opportunities to change her life around, and the state gave her a car and a full ride to college, but her pill popping and alchohol swigging was better to consume her childhood pain. I was molested by a female first and years later raped by a male. I was not even crawling at the time when the female made me touch her. I remember vision was there a lot of my senses were there, but I remember the details of the blanket I was stomach down on and the hallway past the white door that was open! I remember the female coming in and removing her light dark tanish or grey towel. She had curly brown hair and kinda light tan skin. She put both knees on the blanket sitting on her calves across from me legs open. She had took me and sat my face closer to her darkish brown pubes and pushed my mouth in her vagina and I remember the smell and taste of something fruity she used or put on during the shower that is so vivid to me to this day, and memory cuts off but I remember thinking I knew what house this was but I dont. Sometimes i think my mom did this to me i dont know and i will try as hard as i can to find out so i can shame that person bringing a hardship many people would say is light in capacity! I remember the male wearing some type of mask and when I remembered that when I got older I knew that person would still been apart of or was in my life hiding and building a relationship with me in secrecy. A lot of sexual abuse happens by family especially when you are young. I was 5 or 6 at that time I just know I was young. They then proceeded to put a pornograpic magazine in front of me and put me on my knees and then being raped. I feel now more than before I was first told this happened to me more than once a lot more seems to probably have taken place with this scenario quite a few times. I grew up my whole life now knowing but most likely deep down did. I'm a good person I had went to a mental treatment for 44 days I coped with it finding ways to help me one of them was ""grounders"" your 6 senses when you felt triggered. I was diagnosed with bipolar depression. I experienced a lot of manic episodes and a lot other emotions holding two thoughts together one being negative or one being positive and one out weighting the other. Please share if you have any questions. You should always speak up no matter what the circumstances is it will stop the patern and from you living life hurt no one deserves any time of pain.

I came into this Chinese place, got a meal to go (actually two, but for the sake of a shorter story I'm not going to go into why), and left. I sat down on a random bench outside and pulled out my food only to realise that it didn't come with any eating utensils (no, not even chopsticks).

I didn't want to go back in and ask for them, and I can't imagine any other place would let me just come in, grab a fork, and leave, so I just kinda walked around for a while with this bag of Chinese food I can't eat, looking into windows for places I can buy something cheap and grab a disposable fork on the way out. I didn't see any.

2837,I can't redeem my Google play gift cards until they're cleared by a shady 'security team.',"I purchased $300 worth of google play gift cards precisely 3 weeks ago. Upon attempting to redeem them, they failed and I got the need more information message as well. However, there was a link or button to click that takes you to a form. The form requires photographs of the front and back of gift card (Google must be in love with its own logo to want so many pictures of it as that's all that is on the front) as well as photos of the receipt, your form of payment, and a utility bill 'proving you're you.'

No, this is not a joke.

I submitted all of these things later that same day I purchased the cards. I've called and/or chatted with Google play support 20-30 times so far. I'm told by their support that ""they got scammed,"" and ""this process is to protect all customers from fraud."" I asked how I was at risk of fraud seeing as I bought the cards from a local retailer. Must be some nasty stories out there about Walgreens scamming it's customers left and right with counterfeit goods......riiihgghhtt. I told them don't try to be the hero, this ""process"" is to protect you from fraud not me, clearly. 

Support will not give me any kind of ETA and hide behind the mantra ""this is being handled by our security team, we cannot provide any updates."" 

The ""security team"" does not apparently have a phone according to one of the reps nor can they be reached by email. .......what are they in the fucking future? What corporate tech employee does not have a phone or email?

Of course I know they have both but they are not willing to communicate directly with their SOL customers, I'm only mentioning this to show how insulting I've thus far found this entire experience.

2958,Sam Smith &amp; They,"https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/sam-smith/attitude-magazine-interview-they/

A psychiatrist's and psychotherapist's thoughts on daily news

What's new in society? 

Sam Smith &amp; They 
A growing portion of the younger generation is distancing itself from gender (gender roles, gender identification, gender codes and models etc.). This is the farewell to gender related social  responsabilities and old social contracts which had been signed by older generations. Social contracts result from social needs. In the past it was necessary to reproduce and thus to ensure the survival of society. Later it was crucial to ensure that wealth remains in the clan's hands. These needs created a strong feminine and masculine profile with all the necessary values and attitudes. Nowadays these social needs are less relevant. We are nearly 8 bilion people on earth and nobody has to worry that the further development of the society is in danger if one does not reproduce. At the same time less and less kids of rich people are ready to follow the footsteps of their parents because they have plenty of possibilities to create their own life and financial security. So why enter into the gender contract with society when there is no need for it? 
Additionally and parallely to this development,  sex is losing its social importance. For a growing part of society there are many other ways to feel happy and satisfaction is easily available. Fun and satisfaction are achievable through education and knowledge, the financial resources to create an own life and business and the tramandeously increased socialization. All those abilities are based on increasing access to information through the internet, giving access to knowledge on a global scale. It's fun to know and understand things, to develop an own businesses and to stay in touch with other people. Step by step, all those fun factors are pushing the sex fun factor from the stage. The new generation is paving the way for more social fun with less sex seaking and without gender boundaries. 
Taken from the other side, how the society reacts to the homosexual and not-gender-bounded sexual relantionships, it appiers the same effect of tolerance and less importance. Nobody feels disturbed by what ever kind of minorities behavior in the huge number of humans and planty of opportunities. The feeling of everything is possible is dominating. A planty of sex toys and sex robots accomplish the abundance of possibilities to achieve the sexual satisfaction. The vision of sexual paradise has been created as a part of the social paradise in which there are no limits, no boundaries and everything is possible and achievable, the individuals need only to rise their hands for that what they appreciate. 
The only challenge in this society are, like in every other society, the others: do they cooperate and how they cooperate? But even thus limitations loose their brizancy because of the huge number of potential contacts. Practically any kind of personal development cannot longer be rare. A planty of new and recently unusual groups and movements rise up like a bubbles in the boiling water. And this all seems to be funny for the audience without boundaries.",/r/firstworldproblems/comments/djolz7/sam_smith_they/,1571410374,0

2960,"When my bespoke tailor visited my office for my yearly fitting I was wearing another tailor’s clothes, and now he’s hurt and offended.","I’ve been using ”Stefan” for about five years now, and he’s been great: one-week turnaround delivery for orders by phone anywhere in the world based on recorded measurements, yearly adjustment fittings, reasonable prices with wonderful fabrics from Britain and Italy, will copy styles from any famous designer, and can customize right down to the thread and stitching.

Tonight I have a casual event so instead of one of Stefan’ suits and business shirts I’m wearing a favorite off-the rack muslin shirt and sport coat &amp; slacks which I had made by a local shop while I was on vacation last year.

Normally Stefan is chatty, effusive, and pleasant, but when he saw what I was wearing began commenting on it— the fit, the fabric, the lining, the detailing, the style, everything was “poor-quality” or “Ill-fitting” or “out of fashion.”

This is the first time I’ve had a bad experience with Stefan, and I can’t get over the fact that not only was he put off that I was wearing someone else’s clothes, but that he was so snobbish about it.

I discussed with my husband what I want to ask for (20% more) and he suggested I ask less because he knows how much I hate my job and wants me to switch and be happy. He's also a manager at his company and is familiar with salaries in the domain and said the sum is on the higher end of the range. 

At the interview today I really clicked with the people and at the end they asked what my salary expectations are and I gave them a lower sum (&lt;10% more) The manager seemed a little too pleased with my answer which makes me think I should've asked for the initial one.",/r/firstworldproblems/comments/dd9vvu/asked_less_than_the_salary_i_wanted_at_an/,1570207337,0

3053,am i a stalker?,"After my first rollercoaster relationship we decided to call it quits and I accepted it and got on with my life. I see him all around campus and sometimes he talks to me. Before talking to me he unfriended me on Facebook so I just got on with my life. However afterwards, a couple of days later, I accidentally like one of his tweets one evening, and he deactivated the account. And I only realised this after two or so months. Then on his birthday weekend I on two occasions get off the bus early from uni to my house and his area is along the way to my place. Then later on campus I'm getting a bus from the gym and realise that I MIGHT see him and understand what I'm doing is not okay so I move away. I've since avoided my impulses to see him.

I mean, it was intentional that I got off the bus earlier than usual and I knew that I have to walk past his area. I think I was hoping to see him on all of those occasions. I was going home but I also was at that bus stop hoping to see him. Another occasion went to the bar with my friend because he sometimes goes there with his friends. Not cool, I know.

What if he saw me? What if I ruined his day?I feel SO GUILTY. I feel like dying. I know what I did isn’t okay, but I just need some help. I’m sick to my stomach. I'd appreciate your input as my friends, therapist and family keep on saying I'm NOT a stalker but I just can't get out of this spiral.

The main thing I want in a phone is longevity, and that's why I have to consider Apple despite hating them. iOS gets updates so far into the life of a phone, it's not even funny. 

However, in the case of the OnePlus 7(T) Pro I do quite like the phone itself and it's features. Comparing the 7 Pro to the XR is like comparing a watch to a banana. However, OnePlus runs Android. How long do Android phones realistically last assuming the hardware is not the problem? If Android phones can last even 3-4 years, I think I'd be fine. 

How is the build quality on OnePlus 7? Do they release too many phones per year making yours irrelevant very quickly?

Previous jobs would only give me, like, 5 sick days a year but this job has been pretty generous about PTO and I'm not used to it. 


 It's partly because I suck at asking for PTO, and partly because whenever I or family members would plan something, it would either be too last minute or someone else on my team would already have those day off. I've had to cancel about 4 vacation ideas because of this :/ I always get so nervous about asking for time off because I've had bosses in the past get annoyed or pull the ""I dunno we'll see, we're pretty busy.""


Back in July, I got promoted to a new department in the same company. My old department had the type of dynamic where if 1+ person was out, it would hurt the rest of the team for that day. My new department is more flexible. When I told my new boss my PTO situation, she nearly had a heart attack. Now I'm being pressured into deciding what days to take, but they can't be during  busy weeks, which I wont know what those are until the beginning of the month.

3199,First world problems should be ironic,"First world problems should be humorous and ironic, to do with a luxury that only affluent people encounter. The irony stems from the juxtaposition between what gives you grief and the hardships that people living in poverty have to endure. Thus, the juxtaposition should be between poverty and a **middle-class** lifestyle. A first world problem is pretty minor compared to what poor people have to deal with, as people in third world countries don't live with the technology that people in developed countries live with. ""Technology"" here doesn't only refer to smartphones&amp;mdash;it refers to infrastructure, utilities and systems (such as public transport) that make society function smoothly. A well-functioning political system also features as a first-world luxury.

Some of the posts here have been more just general complaints. Just because you live in a developed country or you have money, does not mean that your complaints automatically are ""first world problems"". For example,

[Having someone call you the wrong name](https://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldproblems/comments/cz4s3s/every_morning_a_coworker_passes_by_my_desk_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) does not relate to technology.

[Sitting in a chair at a tennis match](https://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldproblems/comments/cwwno5/someone_gave_me_box_seat_tickets_to_the_us_open/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) is something most people do in first world countries&amp;mdash;this problem juxtaposes between rich people and middle-class people as opposed to juxtaposing between poverty and middle-class people.

[Not being able to order food online](https://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldproblems/comments/cyhcwc/the_taco_bell_that_just_opened_a_few_blocks_away/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) **surpasses** first-world status. ""First-world"" merely means that food is available in the first place. Compare than with third-world countries, where the problem is about not having food available in the first place.

[Hassles with filling a cup with ice and water from a machine](https://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldproblems/comments/cxp975/my_company_has_new_machines_that_can_dispense/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) is a complaint, and it is not an ironic reflection on how your technology differs from third-world technology.

Generally, I think that some posts here are more complaints than critical reflections of how your life is different to poor people. The point of acknowledging a first world problem is to humorously  realize how your concerns pale when compared to the concerns of people living in third world countries. The point is that, as affluent people, we live comfortable lives, and we forget how comfortable our lives are. But, sometimes, we remember that a problem we think is important, is actually petty when compared to people living in third-world countries.",/r/firstworldproblems/comments/czx0y2/first_world_problems_should_be_ironic/,1567664610,0

3207,My Parents in their 70's still don't understand the concept of a cold drink or how fridges work,"I love my folks, they are great parents and grandparents, but they just dont seem to understand the concept of a cold drink being more enjoyable, or how chilling things work, or even ice

I'm 41, my parents are in their mid 70s. When i lived with them until my mid twenties we always had a working fridge in the house that kept food in it, but i dont think either of them understand the concept of keeping drinks in there or that certain drinks taste nicer when chilled.

They understand that ice cream at room temperature is not nice, and they understand that letting dinner go cold can make it far less appealing, but cold drinks tasting nicer and being more refreshing, that's just plain foolish.

As a kid they used to wonder why i drank so much milk, becasue it was the only drink kept in the bloody fridge! Why not make cold drink with ice cubes? This was England in the 80's we didnt have those giant American full height double door refidgerators, like all British households of the time we had one of those half height fridges that go from floor to just under counter height, with a tiny ice compartment at the top that you may be just about lucky enough to get a tub of icecream in and maybe a bag of peas, but never the 10 cube ice tray, that is of course if you can open the damn thing, those compartments froze shut  at the drop of an eye, you either needed a full on arctic explorers ice axe to get in, welding torch or a local wizard to speak the elvish word for friend after those things froze up.

So yeah, during my childhood, cold drinks at home were a rarity, but getting older it didnt get much better. in my mid to late teens Beer became a part of my life. TV shows or adverts talking about cracking open a cold one made me wonder what i was missing. I would put a six pack in the fridge to find my parents had taken it out to make room for food (even though there was always enough room for both) cue the conversation

Me: ""Dad, where are the beers i put in the fridge?""  
Dad: ""I took them out, dont worry, they'll be cold!""  
Me: ""they were only in there for 15 minutes, that wont have chilled them at all""  
Dad: ""I Put them in a cold place, son, dont worry!""  
Me: ""What cold place?""  
Dad: ""In the cupboard under the stairs"".........

Now, let me stop you there, if we are going to get technical, yes the cupboard under the stairs was colder than the rest of the house, Technically my dad was right, in his own mind he was doing  good, but that cupboard was about 0.1 degrees colder than the rest of the house, so as far as that being in ideal place to put drinks in and come back to find them chilled to perfection that wasn't going to happen.

They now live 100 miles away, new build house, bigger kitchen, massive fridge, whenever i go to visit with my family i politely ask the night before if they can put a couple of drinks in the fridge, but they still dont quite get it.

Me: \*drinks warm beer\* ""Dad, where did this beer come from, the fridge or the stair cupboard?""  
Dad: ""It should be cold son, its come from the fridge""  
Me: ""It's pretty much room temperature, is your fridge working""  
Dad: ""The fridge is fine, i put the drinks in there 15 minutes ago""  
Me: ""15 minutes is not long enough for a drink to chill dad""  
Dad: ""but it's been in the fridge, it should be cold""  
Me ""15 minutes is not long enough, a drink visiting the fridge for a short perios of time does not make it cold""  
Dad: ""but it's been in the fridge, it should be cold"" .......

the conversation loop beigns here, always friendly, but it's pretty much our version of ""This one goes up to 11"", ""whay not make 10 louder?""

My sister an I clubbed together to buy them a drinks fridge, that they can permanatly keep drinks in, no more requesting drinks to go in the night before. We though we were being smart, 

Me: \*drinks warm beer\* ""Dad, where did this beer come from, the drinks fridge or the stair cupboard?""  
Dad: ""It should be cold son, its come from the drinks fridge""  
Me: ""When did you put the drinks in?""  
Dad: ""they've been in there since your last visit""  
Me: ""It's pretty much room temperature, is your fridge working""  
Dad: ""Yes, it all shuddered to life when i turned it on 30 minutes ago""........

A couple of weeks age we went down for a weekend, it was hot, i was buying BBQ food to cook for them and decided a couple of Gin and Tonics would be lovely in those conditions.

Me: ""right dad, meat is sorted, gin and tonic sorted, do you have ice at home?""  
Dad: ""yes son, plenty!""  
Me: ""are you sure?""  
Dad: ""Yes son, i'm sure""  
Me: ""dad, you know we have different definitions of what plenty of ice means""  
Dad: ""yep""  
\*we get home with the supplies\*  
Me: ""Dad, im making G&amp;T's for four of us can you bring the ice please""  
\*dad appears with an 9 hole ice tray, all half filled, all about the dimensions of a £2 coin\*  
Me: ""Dad, is this the plenty of ice?""  
Dad: ""yes Son, nine bits of ice, thats one for each drink with a spare!"".......

Whenever they come to mine, i always serve them chilled drinks, and i always get the same response  
Dad: ""this beer is really nice son, what is it?""  
Me: ""same stuff as i bring to yours, it's just served cold like it's recomended""  
Mum: ""what about this G&amp;T, it tastes lovely""  
Me: ""same stuff that we bring down, the difference is the tonic is chilled and its got plenty of ice""  
\*mum and dad look confusedly at each other\*

3298,My MIL is paying for a honeymoon that it is honestly going to be a burden to take.,"I just started a new job in February as a legal assistant.  I went through 90 days as a probationary employee but I started out as part-time and got promoted to full-time after a month or so, so I just finished my 90 days in June.

My employer offers no benefits at all and we don't get PTO until we have worked here for 1 year, non-probationary...aka next June for me. After June, I only get 5 days PTO.  This sucks bad enough, but my wedding is next April and my MIL (without asking, mind you) booked a TEN DAY cruise for our honeymoon. That means I am taking eight days unpaid off of work.

I asked her if she could change the cruise to a shorter one or change the date to next June instead of April and she said absolutely not; apparently she paid a non-refundable deposit of $1,000 or something like that.

Thankfully I talked to my boss and she is giving me 5 days of my honeymoon as PTO but I'm not going to get to take another paid day off until June of 2021. For those of you wondering, that is 14 months with no paid vacation whatsoever.

I settle for a glass on wine and accept that fact that I've chosen to go to bed hungry.

As I lay down, I can't help but reflect back on the ridiculous things that I allow to stress me out or cause some form of negativity in my mindset throughout the day..and it dawned on me..I had one of those lightbulb moments.

I truly forget just how lucky I am to have the life I do. My family, my significant other, my job, the place I call home, and all the stability that Im fortunate enough to have..It's nothing short of a gift.

3430,Robbed of my prime... and childhood...,"I grew up in a good upper-middle-class household, with more than enough money to go around for all my family. My parents never allowed me to get any of the new things. They never bought me anything. Ever. Ever since I was young I have loved videogames though. I grew up playing the OG Xbox for the first 5 years of my life. Within those five years the following things came out:

* Xbox 360
* halo 3
* halo reach
* halo 4
* COD BO1
* COD BO2
* COD Ghosts
* Nintendo DS (DSI) 
* WII u

I had to grow up with all of my friends getting the new toys, games, and consoles. All the while I had to listen to them brag about how they have this and that, and how the new story in the game was so amazing, and how I had to play it!  But I couldn't. I couldn't do anything. I basically had no friends over ever because my overprotective mother who NONE of my friends could stand. I could never go to their houses because my mother was (still) overprotective. I had to sit at lunch every day at school and listen to all the cool kids talk about their games... everything that I was missing out on. I would make up stories to fit in all the time, and for a short while, my peers listened. But when they realized I was lying they stopped listening and ignored me. I would try to go to my friend's houses and I would just sit on their games for hours and hours while they basically begged me to go outside... but I couldn't. I had this BURNING desire to play everything that my DAMN mother kept me from. I LONGED to fit in. I needed to fit in... I needed to be able to talk to my friends about my sick killstreak, or my slick assassination. I longed for the acknowledgment of my peers. I felt so sad and lost every day when I went to school. I later resorted to buying my own consoles but me being only 8 years old I couldn't do much. My parents barely paid me to do anything even while they told me ""You wanna earn money do some chores"" but then when I tried to they would just tell me to GO TO THE FUCKING NEIGHBORS AND ASK FOR THINGS TO DO. I WAS FUCKING EIGHT.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up saving my birthday money for 2 years just to get an Xbox 360 in 2014. By then all my friends had the Xbox One and I was once again left in the past... I didn't even get to use Xbox live for a long time because my mom thought that I would get kidnapped by a pedophile on the other side of the screen. But when I finally got Xbox Live I was good. I was INSANE at the games I played. I played amazingly like I was made to play it. I would destroy lobby after lobby of kids and adults alike, whether or not they were my level or higher. I started to realize that everything I had missed was everything that I had dreamed it would be... but I became obsessed. I would do nothing but play Halo 4 for days at a time in the summer. I went days without going outside. It was horrible. I would go back to school and try to talk about how great I was at my games but people would just ignore me and make fun of me because I was a ""Last Gen"" or a player from a previous generation of gaming console. I was empty... even lost. I spent most of my childhood chasing a dream that I could never obtain.

&amp;#x200B;

Years later I would finally move up to the Xbox One S after receiving it for Christmas. But don't get it twisted, the only reason that I got it is because my mother noticed that I had been crying myself to sleep because I had switched schools because I felt that I had no friends and I had failed as a child. I was 14 acting like I was 41 in a mid-life crisis trying desperately to chase my youth. Trying to find what was missing from my life. And I knew what it was. I didn't have any friends because I couldn't fit in. And she had finally seen the VERY TIP of the iceberg that she left in my childhood... how could she ever understand now... I watch videos all the time of people playing my favorite game back when it first released. I could've been a professional Competitive player in the Esports scene had I been provided the tools possible to do so. Or maybe I just could've grown up normally, playing with my real-life friends online.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for a present-day update. My name is Joshua. I am seventeen, I have graduated high school, and I am still chasing that broken dream. The only difference is that nowadays I know I can never reach that feeling of love, or belonging from all the friends of my childhood. Hell. Now I don't even have anyone to impress. I just get up, work, come home, play Xbox, call my girlfriend, and then play games until about 1:00 AM every night. No more friends to talk to, nobody to impress. The only real friends I have now are my Xbox Live friends. But even because of that my mom complains that I'm always on my console and that she never sees me anymore. And truth be told she's right. She doesn't see me very much anymore. Because of how much she over sheltered me, I have grown to resent her. She doesn't know why, and she doesn't bother to ask even though ""it tears her up inside"" how badly I treat her. (but I really am just snippy and ignore her)

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I see it... she specifically robbed me. Not only of my childhood but of my future. A future that I would have loved to see... and I have tried to tell her this but she just cries and says that I think she's a terrible mother. I even tried to tell her what she could do to be more likable and how we could grow as a family. But she completely ignored it and went on about her business. And now she completely forgot again. And I honestly feel that if I were to tell her all this, or even show her this post she would just try to leave my family completely, or for a few months disappear. And I can't do that to my family because deep down I love them all. As much as I tell myself I hate them, or I just want to leave... I don't. I just want so badly to be sat down, held, apologized to and just cry with me. I just want love. And acknowledgment. I want to be heard. I want to be understood. And I might be able to have that... if only I could tell them.

&amp;#x200B;

But instead, I remain. Broken. Sad. Lost. I will remain hollow, and a shadow. Simply because I refuse to let go because every time I bring up my problems I either get judged because boys aren't supposed to cry, or my mom can't handle it. So. Until I find a way to finally get this off my chest...

&amp;#x200B;

3437,I have too many options to choose from!,"Okay, let me break this down for everyone who may not be aware of one of our societies and, as well as, human behavior problems today. 

We live in a world full of opportunity. Anything we need, want or crave is at our direct disposal. 

Want a double ported high volume HDMI 1080p cable only manufactured and distributed in the Swiss Alps? Have no fear! Amazon will have it at your front door step in less than 24 hours with a high quality 4K photo emailed to each one of your electronic devices all alerting you at the same time like an Amber Alert. Not to mention it’s cheaper than any electronic store in a 20 mile radius. 

Direct effect example: Radio Shack out of business

Need a new car? Well we have exactly what you need! As you can see, here on this strip of road we have: Ford, Chevy, Chrysler, Kia, Fiat, Hyundai, Honda, Toyota, Scion, Audi, BMW and Mercedes Dealerships. Many options to choose from and they’re all there conveniently placed and exposed for your personal discretion. 

You’ve purchased Chevrolet your whole life but the choices...why not test drive them all!? 

Direct effect example: America’s auto industry needs government help to prevent bankruptcy, forcing each company to decrease productivity and consumer vehicle options. Resulting in frequent lay-offs. 

I believe, and this is just my highly intelligent hypothesis, that this is manipulating our minds to think there are so many options, at all times, that you don’t have to be loyal to one item, person or food. 

This has created more jobs by companies who have decided to start a business or company in a similar market, but in turn have created less total revenue and profit. This is due to the fact with so many available options, you’ve decreased market demand and increased total supply. The affects, have in turn, created your consumer, higher, unaffordable prices. In parallel created a demand for higher minimum wage &gt; which creates higher prices &gt; which  creates higher demands for higher wages &gt; which creates...woah okay! I’m starting sound like a broken record here. I think you get what I am trying to perceive here.

Circle of Life! 

Let’s continue. 

For instance, in the 1950s through the 1970s and possibly into the early 80s, marriages and relationships were maintained and functioned for longer periods of time. I suppose besides that peak rate of divorce in the late 70s. I can’t imagine what would have caused that haha
Could this have been a result of minimun variety for selection? Other than your classmates, co-workers or the familiar friendly faces you would see at your local A&amp;P supermarkets, you had to narrow it down to who was within your living vicinity. Or possibly the belief in God per capita was higher. Which produced higher morale living standards... However, this all has changed drastically! You can now find a date within seconds with an absolute total stranger on any Social Media platform within minutes. And if you aren’t happy at home or are in a broken marriage, you can find countless websites that offer services to fulfill your needs. Consequently causing more and more relationships to end effortlessly, less painfully and more commonly. Not to mention, divorce and separation have been more excepting by society which helps ease the anxiety of feeling ashamed. 

In closing, in my opinion, some of America’s, and quite possibly the World’s, issues are dependent on the fact that producing a “Plan B” is more convenient than committing to, working at and establishing your initial plan, “Plan A.”

I even had a chat with some missionaries just to pass along the time and maybe learn something despite not being religious.

I've gone sky-diving,  I've gone public-speaking, I speak up in class, I donate blood even though I hate needles. I still get so bored.

I used to be NEET for months. But eventually I got so bored I felt forced to get a part-time job just to pass the time. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually like working. 

I've worked all sorts of odd-jobs from deli clerk, debt collector, customer service, car driver and cleaner to package handler just to try a variety of things out.

its stressing me out a little because i have only 3 weeks left to use the gift card and i dont want to buy anything with hurry just to spend it quickly. i've never won so much money in my life before and i THINK i would like to make it special, and lets say, choosing something i would normally not to - but also i'm awfully stubborn and thoughtful and probably will end up buying new necessary bedsheets or something.

3601,My palate hasn't grown as much as my finances have.,"I grew up lower middle class, and in many cases I was significantly more privileged than others. I had a roof over my head and I always went to bed with a full belly. But we lived simply. I grew up on tough, well-done steaks and potatoes, and chicken and rice.  It was simple, but it was calories and it's all I knew.

Now I'm older and I've done OK for myself. I'm not rich by any stretch of the imagination, but I do OK. And I've made friends with folks who grew up this way and the differences in our upbringing really shows when we go out to dinner or attend weddings.

For example, next week I'm attending a wedding where the two dinner options are some duck confit, salmon brulee, and some tofu monstrosity for the vegans out there.

I had to Google each menu item to figure out not just how to pronounce it, but to even know what it was. I didn't even know you could make butter from mushrooms (truffles) , but I digress.

I've tried breaching out at restaurants and it usually ends up with eating mostly dinner rolls and the missus having my meal as leftovers the next day and me swinging by a McDonald's on the way home if I'm still hungry.

3725,I had to wait AN ENTIRE WEEK for something that was supposed to be two day shipping,"Story time!

Buckle up kids, because my life became a freaking Seinfeld episode for a week.

I decided I was paying too much for phones/cell service. My old phone went the planned obsolescence route, so I decided it was time to get a new one. I always get the Samsung Galaxy Note because it is EXCELLENT for drawing/art (I am an artist). But golly gee are those fuckers getting expensive.

So I got the bright idea to cut two costs at once. I learned you can text/make phone calls through an internet connection with a VOIP app. I also learned that you can buy a data only plan from T-Mobile for like $15 a gig. I rarely go over a gig or two, because I'm typically on Wi-Fi.

So I ordered a tablet from Walmart. I decided to go with a tablet instead of a phone because the huge screen would be perfect for my digital art. Ordered it on a Wednesday, said it would be in Walmart pick-up Friday. Friday came, and the FedEx tracking notified me that it was delivered to Walmart. I knew I couldn't go get it without the email confirmation code from Walmart, so I waited for that. A few hours passed, and not a peep from Walmart.

I decided to go in to see customer service and see where the tablet was. I was helped by this new young kid who didn't know how anything worked. We had to wait forever for a supervisor. Once one showed up, I was told that if the package was delivered but I haven't gotten the email yet, they haven't processed it back in shipping yet. I groaned a little because the package had been there for going on six hours now, and that department would be going home for the night soon. But, I was told nothing could be done, so I went home.

I waited all day Saturday for an email notification that never came. Customer service closes at 9, so I went in at 8. There was someone ahead of me in line being helped by this older lady cashier. Her supervisor walked by and asked if she had her break yet, and she replied in a rather irritated manner that no, she had not. He said he would go find a replacement.

Lo and behold, he brings back that kid who didn't know how to help me right as it was my turn. I asked the lady politely if she could help for a quick second, but she almost RAN away saying ""Not my problem, I'm on break!""

So, here we go again, waiting for another supervisor. When one finally comes, he's not sure what's going on either. He gets on his walkie-talkie and calls for someone from the shipping department. We wait some more until the supervisor from shipping makes his way over. We explained the situation to him, and he goes ""Oooooohhh, your package must have been on that FedEx truck that went AWOL and never showed up.""

.............. WTF?

Apparently they waited all day for this FedEx truck, and it never came. I told them that I got a notification from FedEx that it did indeed arrive, and they said to take it up with FedEx.

I went home because customer service and shipping were closing. I called FedEx, and they informed me that their truck showed up, and someone named Russell signed for it. I need to take it up with Walmart.

Oh joy.

At this time of the night, my only option was to call corporate. They decided that the tablet was ""lost"" and they would give me a partial refund for the inconvenience and ship a replacement.

I did eventually get the tablet. The icing on the cake to this whole escapade is that the tablet is a total piece of crap.

Sometimes I wonder about what really happened to the first tablet. Did the FedEx driver just say fuck it and forged a signature, only to sell the contents of the truck on the black market? Does Russel get sticky fingers and take things now and again knowing Walmart will just mark it ""lost""?

Who knows.

TL;DR: I ordered a tablet through Walmart, FedEx claimed they delivered it, Walmart said they never showed up. Got fucked around by customer service and eventually got a replacement.",/r/firstworldproblems/comments/bv1f2n/i_had_to_wait_an_entire_week_for_something_that/,1559266451,0

3746,We make way more money than our friends.,"I hate even posting this. My husband and I both make very good money and are very comfortable. We have been able to kind of “hide” our wealth for the most part because we live in a normal looking house and don’t wear fancy clothes or drive fancy cars. Obviously we don’t complain about money and I feel super awkward when our friends do. I just kind of smile and nod. I can’t relate. I hate that I feel “ashamed” of our wealth sometimes. We are looking at moving and I worry that if we move to a bigger, fancier house, it will be OBVIOUS that we have more. I worry about our friends judging us. I don’t want them to think less of us. I wish I didn’t worry so much what other thought. I am SO SO eternally grateful for what we have.",/r/firstworldproblems/comments/btwwa0/we_make_way_more_money_than_our_friends/,1559027081,0
3747,Someone was rude to me on the interstate and I didn’t get to tell them how wrong they were because they took the wrong exit.,"There’s construction on this road I drive every day, it works like this diagram that I spent too much time making, where there’s 3 different exits to take off of the main exit. I was in the lane farthest to the left, and I exited off the left side of the Y. I didn’t change lanes once.  They were in the farthest right lane and apparently wanted to be headed towards the Y on the road by the asterisk but didn’t realize it went down to one lane before Y’ing off, I was in the one and only lane for this exit and they were behind me and to the right, we were the only people on the road so I don’t exactly know what they wanted me to do, they could have just slowed down. They started honking and flipping me off where the • is below. I tried to say I’m in the only lane but I had to watch them cruising down the super wrong way instead.

“You had a horse?”       
“Well, a few, as a child.”        
“A _few?_ How many?”       
“Only four: one for trail riding, two for show riding, and one I trained from a yearling.”      
“&gt;_&gt;”

Come in to work Monday in a great mood:
“Hey Takatori, you certainly seem chipper! Good weekend?”
Me: “I’ll say! My team took third place in the Bay Cup Saturday.”        
“Bay Cup?”       
“It’s a yearly yacht race.”

“No, it’s my team— they help sail my boat.”     
“You have a yacht?”       
“Well, a small one ... “
“&gt;.&lt;“

Take a week off to visit home, come back bearing gifts of wine for colleagues:
“Wow, thanks Takatori, it says this is from [famous wine-making district], but I don’t recognize the winery.”      
Me: “It’s a boutique winery, only put their house label on rare varietals. The main business is producing private label wines for [well-known brand] and [another], and others.”       
“Very cool! How did you find it?      
“Well, my great-great-grandfather founded it, and we’ve kept it in the family.”      
“You own a winery?!?”       
“No, no, my cousin runs it, I’m only a low-percentage shareholder.”

Sunglasses lens pops out, again, and as I fiddle with popping it in:       
“Again, Takatori? You should buy a new pair.”         
“No way, these cost three grand! I’ll just send them back for replacement.”          
“...”      

Arrive at work in a clean, pressed suit:      
“Takatori, looking sharp! New suit?”        
Me: “No, I just had it re-tailored after losing all that weight for sailing season.”       
“You have your suits tailored?”       
“Doesn’t everybody? How do you get a suit made without tailoring?”       
“Made? Try off the rack ... “        
“I don’t think [mid-range maker popularly believed to be couture] sells off the rack.”     
“@_@”

Arrive at work with a good solid tan after a long weekend:      
“Hey, Takatori got some sun, eh?”     
“Yeah, spend the weekend at the beach.”     
“Oh cool, which one?”     
“[High-end resort town].”

“No, not really; lately I‘be been going more often to my new place in [other famous resort area].”       
“Damn. Bye.”

Come to work Friday with a nondescript messenger bag:
“Hey Takatori, different bag today?”        
Me: “Yeah, I’m spending the weekend in [nearby developing country] and am not comfortable taking my regular bag there.”      
“Huh? Why not?”       
“I’d be worried the brand would make me a target for scammers/pickpockets.”      
“Why, what is it?”

“No, it’s ok; this isn’t a local model, I bought it overseas so it wouldn’t have the mandatory shutter sound.”       
“You bought it outright, not on contract?”

Here are my options:

* My series 1 Apple watch has been going strong for almost 4 years, but it finally started losing it's battery life before the day is over. 
* I have a pair of Bluetooth Beats headphones, but they wrap around my ear and make it difficult to wear when I'm wearing my sunglasses (mowing, biking, pretty much anything outdoors) and am considering getting the AirPods.

I was raised catholic in church EVERY Sunday but it didn’t stick when I left the nest. Shit I was bored in church every time.  Latin this and blah blah blah and shit that doesn’t speak to me.  Either way... I ended up in a very good university and got a very good job and had the MOTHER FUCKING AMERICAN DREAM. Fuck man. I fucking had it. God dammit. Fuck. 

Long story short... I’m driving down the road crying and bawling my eyes out like a little bitch because of what I have done and this Porsche almost swipes me.  I all of the sudden realize I am crying in a $16k civic my parents bought me because they believe in me.  Sometimes the gravity weight of throwing your life away squeezes tears out like a limepress to a Lime.  I feel sorry for myself but I have food, shelter, support.  I have what I imagine an average homeless motherfucker to kill for. And here I am bitching.

3969,Are internet service providers taking advantage of their customers and the general public?,"I am really feed up with my internet service provider. I’ve never taken to the internet and social media for complaining but I wanted to see if there are others having the same issues. 

My location is only being serviced by one internet provider as far as I know. And I’ve been noticing a decline in service and internet speeds for a while now. Since 2018 at least. Which isn’t saying much since I believe I joined in 2017. 

For $160+ a month, I expect to, at the very least, have a service that works, or be able to call customer/tech support or, as a last resort, have someone check it out when things are going wrong.

Here’s what threw me over the edge. My area had an outage yesterday, and we also had our carpet changed on the same day. I put all of the wires back the way they were (with labels and all, and I have successfully moved our routers etc before). But my internet and tv doesn’t work. I thought nothing of it at first. I thought my ISP were not responding on time to customer/tech inquiries due to the outage.

Fast forward to today. I called again and again, tried the online chat with my phone to no avail. And finally, I got hold of a person, only for them to tell me “there’s not much they can do” and they can send out someone but I “might or might not” need to pay $75 just for the person to come out depending on the issue.  

In the past year I had spoken with my neighbors about their thoughts. I understand technology doesn’t work 100% of the time. But NOT A SINGLE PERSON was satisfied with our internet service provider. Someone told me they just canceled it completely and use their hotspot!

She proceeded to say to me: “Aren’t kids like YOU supposed to have a parent with them?” And “People your age shouldn’t have that much money of their own to waste on candy.” I kindly informed her that I had something called an allowance; and that I was able to bike around town by myself. She didn’t take this too well, and started bitching me out saying that my parents didn’t care for me; and that if they did, I wouldn’t be by myself in a public place. Her 5-6 year old daughter tried to stop the EM, as she was making a scene, but was thrown to the side. Eventually the cashier called management to have the nuisance removed.

How nice, she was so dear, and I smiled at her but kept my distance because of a terrible smell of farts.

Then it got weird again and I told my friend (I’ll call her Ella) and she said break up with him again. I told her I wasn’t sure if I wanted to do that. She said to just do it. I told her how when we were apart I missed him so so much but when we were together there was some awkward tension in the air. She still told me to do it. I did it. And almost regretted it right after. I still really liked him but she was my best friend. No past drama and a bunch of funny inside jokes. She was a year below so she was in grade 6. We were still close. A couple weeks fast forward and I’m really missing my ex. Breaking up was a huge mistake. Then he started sitting next to Ella and when I wasn’t there he was apparently putting his arm around her (friends told me) I ended up asking her if they were dating, trying to keep my cool (she was becoming really distant and not wanting to talk to me so it wasn’t like i should’ve known. She was almost ignoring me) when she told me I lost it. I was crying. She knew I would never do that to her.  I asked her since when and she said a couple of weeks ago. Mind you we broke up in January and now this February. I freaked cause we had just broke up. I was crying so much and telling my other friends what she did. It ended up boiling down to This: she broke us up cause she liked him and it wasn’t like it’s completely her fault but it still hurt. She knew how I felt.

I am the sole provider for a stay at home mom, and 3 children (one with Special needs). I can barely make ends meet, and while the kiddos have insurance, mine lapsed because even the low payment was too high at the moment.

Folks, my teeth are not the best. I brush, floss, gargle, but they seem to be giving up the fight. When I had Indiana insurance, the dentist just wanted to yank them. That’s it. So I would have been walking around with a mere handful of teeth. Damn near gumby status.

We live in a nation where advancements are so great that they can implant replacement teeth into your mouth and you can have improved oral (AND mental health), but it will cost you more than you can make in several years even if you have insurance. (Yeah, even private health insurance companies see it as “Cosmetic” .

I suppose I should feel guilty for wanting dental implants when people in developing nations have their teeth rotting out of their heads, but when I think about it, I just can’t feel guilty. Damn it, we have the technology here, we have the ability...and yet....

4390,I know this is probably a first world problem but I got a really bad haircut today and I’m super upset,"Today I went and had to get a haircut. I had a really important shoot tomorrow to get some pictures for my modeling portfolio (just hoping to get a few extra bucks with ads, not as a career but still doing it for fun too). I’ve been really excited for this hoping I can get some jobs. 

So I get there and the lady clearly looks like she doesn’t want to be there. She brings me to her stations and there is stray hairs all over her table, and I mean everywhere. She smelled like smoke and went straight into cutting my hair without even asking anything. I was like, “okay I’m sure it’ll be fine and I’m just being judge mental.” I tried to strike up a conversation but she continued to ignore me. 

As it goes on my hair just starts to look choppy and not even. When she asked me if it was good and I looked, one side had a whole good other inch in length. It was uneven so I asked her to make them even. She kept insisting if I tucked my hair behind my ear, it would be even. I told her I don’t tuck my hair behind my ear, please, make it even. I wear my hair down and that’s where I would like it to match. She kept insisting and insisting before finally cutting it. 

I was getting super anxious from her not listening to me but tried to just breathe it out and hopefully let her fix it. Finally when the sides where even enough, still not the best but better, she asked if I liked it and I said yes. Well then she continued to CUT ONE SIDE EVEN SHORTER SO THEY WERE UNEVEN AGAIN. I decided to just leave before she did any worse because I had a feeling my hair would just keep getting shorter. 

I left her a tip anyways because I didn’t want to be rude but ended up crying in the car and called my mom about it. The more I look at my hair the more upset I am. I keep it longer in the front so there’s a sort of diagonal cut but it’s really bumpy and not straight at all. My hair is way shorter than I intended and she made a lot of cutting decisions that I had never seen any other hairdresser make. 

I know my hair will grow back, but as of right now I’m so disappointed. She ignored me completely and what I wanted and sort of did whatever she wished. I was excited for my photos tomorrow but now it has to be postponed until next month when my hair grows back. It was so frustrating and I’m continuing to be anxious about the whole situation. 

No it’s not the worst haircut in the world and I know people have probably had it way worse, but i really still can’t get over it. Thanks for listening to my stupid rant. ",/r/firstworldproblems/comments/ajwtrz/i_know_this_is_probably_a_first_world_problem_but/,1548470306,0

4437,Mother deliberately destroying valuable clothing,"Hi,

This will be a little hard to understand. I'm under the age of 18 so I can't legally do anything about it. 

The situation:
The clothes I usually wear are polyester or some other fabric that definitely should not be fast washed at 60°c. I've asked her on multiple occasions to tell me when she plans on doing the washing so I can hand wash my own clothes to prevent damage.

I don't want to set off an argument, however over £240 worth of shirts and hoodies have practically been damaged - stiff, shrunk in size etc. 

I know this sounds ridiculous but over half my shirts are unwearable out in public due to the fabric being very damaged, in fact all of my ""hype"" shirts look like someone tried to sandpaper them down. 

I have this one shirt worth £120 that I really don't want damaged and It's coming to the point where I'm literally hiding it. 

Basically none of my socks fit me after one wash and they go all stiff and uncomfortable, even though when i first buy them they are very very stretchy.

Also broke me doesn't have enough money for new clothes as all of the ones i used to be able to wear were designer expensive things.

I don't want to damage relations with my mother and neither do I want anything against her, Didnt know exactly where to post this but not gonna lie this whole thing pisses me off, and I can't keep asking my father to buy me new clothes since my old ones are damaged.

Even my 100% cotton shirts are rock solid.

Sorry for the rant but I'm lost and don't know what to do,

Thank you,

No big deal, takes like 10 minutes and they were able to see me within the hour it happened. Every time I go there though I cant help but question a few things. 

The waiting room has a nice big TV yet they always just use it to show a slide show of adverts for the dental office... Like, why would you need to advertise if the person is already in the waiting room for treatment through you? Wouldnt it make more sense to put literally any channel on instead?

They also offer complimentary coffee, fraps, cookies, juices, and soda. Which is nice, but makes me kinda feel awkward at the end of the day when my dental hygienist is offering to make me a frap or smoothie when my entire face is numb. 

And finally, they have ceiling mounted TVs in the rooms where they lean you back so you can be 'entertained' sure... Alright, but they are always muted and playing home renovation shows every time Im there. Which really sucks, because you are still left to deal with the awkward small talk they always try and make when they have 2 instruments in your mouth. 

Overall, so much potential, but a bit lacking on the execution in my opinion, also.... They have a massage lounge but no hot tub. And thats just a petty thing, but Im just saying, why have 4 super expensive massage chairs, when you could have a hot tub. Not sure why a dental office needs a hot tub, but then again Im not sure why they have all these other frills either so at this point Im just throwin in my full 2 cents.

4485,When you're 8 minutes late to a doctor's appointment and they offer to book you in again in 5 weeks' time," 

I   have a cyst that's at least doubled in size quite rapidly and was told   my GP could carry out minor surgery to remove it. As he was fully  booked with surgeries, however, I had to wait 4 weeks to get this  appointment. I set out early this morning but encountered roadworks on  the way and was told that I would have to walk a different path to  usual. This took  an extra 10 minutes, which was fine because I had  factored that in and  got to the medical site at 9am for my appointment.  As I got closer to  the actual building, however, I saw that there were  constructions going on and there was a large notice saying I needed to  use a different entrance to usual. I walked around the entire building  and realised that  I was going to be late so called the reception to  inform them. They offered me additional directions but at no point  mentioned that my  lateness was going to be an issue. I arrived at  Reception at 9:08 and was informed that, because I was late, the doctor  would not see me and  that I could book another appointment in 5 weeks'  time.

I've been to this surgery before.  They're always late even if you book the  first appointment of the day,  but I've always waited patiently and never complained. I told them this  and mentioned the fact that at no point in any communications with me  had they mentioned the construction work going on, but they said that if  they let me have my appointment then the next person would be held up  and so on. I completely understand that and I apologised, mentioning the  roadworks and construction, and saying that I had never before been  late to an appointment, but they said the best they could do was book me  in for another appointment in 5 weeks'  time.

I  had to re-arrange my entire schedule today to make this appointment  (they only do cyst removals on Thursday mornings) and told them that I  couldn't take time off like this again.

4514,"""Words and Phrases I Learned in 2018""","A list titled ""Words and Phrases I Learned in 2018"" was posted on Facebook but I'm not going to link it because it contains personal info. Here's the list though:

* Big-4: Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft. The original top 4 companies before newer companies became big.
* Big-N: The highest-paying, most desirable companies that everyone has heard of encompassing Big-4, FAANG, Bloomberg, Dropbox, Twitter, Uber, Snap, Yahoo, Yelp, and other top companies.
* Diversity: The experience of instant rejection after you admit to being an Asian male on a job application. A similar phenomenon also occurs commonly on dating apps.
* DS&amp;A: Data structures and algorithms, the most common of type of question asked at interviews.
* FAANG: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google. Five tech giants with exponential stock growth in recent years.
* Goldman Sachs: Where you work if you can’t get a Big-N job but need to convince your girlfriend you have money and “want prestige with the plebs” - [name redacted]
* Grind LeetCode: To practice solving leaked interview questions on LeetCode for 12-16 hours in a single sitting for multiple days or weeks in a row while neglecting your social life. Grinding LeetCode is necessary for getting a job at a Big-N. Side effects include depression and anxiety.
* HackerRank: A website that administers timed coding tests, which are usually the second step of the job application process, after the resume screening. This is done to filter out completely incompetent candidates who look good on paper. If you fail at this stage, stop moaning and go study because there’s no way you would’ve passed the later stages anyway.
* Hedge fund: Companies that are smaller but even more desirable than Big-N and usually only interview target school grads. Examples include Bridgewater, Two Sigma, and RenTec. Jane Street is technically a prop shop, not a hedge fund, but a lot of people misidentify it as one and I think it falls in the same category as hedge funds.
* IMO/IOI: International Mathematical Olympiad and International Olympiad in Informatics respectively. The former is a very prestigious math competition, the latter a very prestigious programming competition. People who have won medals in these are multiple times smarter than me and have no problem finding a hedge fund job or a girlfriend.
* Math Stacy: A very physically attractive woman with at least a bachelor’s degree in or equivalent knowledge of pure math. These women are the most desirable for men to date.
* Memoization: A lazy hack that you pull on a dynamic programming problem if you don’t know how to solve it properly. This involves storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Interviewers are generally not thrilled with this but it’s better than not solving the problem at all.
* New York City/Silicon Valley: The only two places in the world where jobs worth applying to exist.
* Onsite: The final round of interviews that happens in person consisting of 4-6 back-to-back interviews. For each round, you will be asked to answer a DS&amp;A or system design question on a whiteboard and/or laptop in 45 minutes, followed by 15 minutes for you to ask your interviewer any questions you have.
* Putnam: The most prestigious math competition in North America and probably the world too. The top 5 contestants are named “Putnam fellows.” The next 20 win smaller cash prizes. Winning anything here is almost a ticket to a hedge fund job and/or any math Ph.D. program of your choice.
* Renaissance Technologies: “a small and shitty asset management firm with poor performance lol” - [name redacted]
* Softwarecuck: A corporate slave who writes software all day to survive the high cost of living in NYC/Si Valley.
* Superday: The equivalent of an onsite at an investment bank. At a superday, there are multiple candidates interviewing at the same time. The night before the superday, the bank puts you and the other candidates in the same hotel and serves you dinner and alcohol, and you can all network with each other. A lot more behavioral questions are asked at a superday compared to at an onsite.
* SWE/SDE: Software Engineer and Software Development Engineers respectively. Software Engineers write software for Facebook or Google. Software Development Engineers write software for Amazon or Microsoft.
* TC: Total compensation. The total dollar amount when base salary, stock, signing bonus, and performance bonuses are added together.
* Target school: Schools that every Asian parent wants their child to go to. Includes MIT, Caltech, HMC, CMU, any Ivy League, Cooper, Stanford, Duke, U Chicago, and other top schools. Attending one of these is your only hope of avoiding the “applied to 30 jobs, not a single interview” bullshit.
* Unicorn: A startup worth $1B+. Usually worth applying to, especially if they plan to IPO soon.",/r/firstworldproblems/comments/abqovp/words_and_phrases_i_learned_in_2018/,1546409959,0

4603,Why am I heading into work on the 21st to issue a document set to a client by the end of the day? No one’s going to read it for at least a week.,"I mean, seriously? At worst they will read them on the 27th but I know for *sure* they won’t look at them until the 4th. 

It ridiculous I’m working this hard to hit deadlines that don’t matter. End of last week, fair enough. But now? 

What’s worse is that this happens every year.....

Also, I have insomnia, and haven’t slept in 24 hours. 

Happy Holidays everyone.

4604,Hair in the sandwich my mum made me.,"I live abroad and my mum is visiting and she made me a sandwich for work because she knows I'm poor and hungry. She made two sandwiches, the second one had a long hair in it and now I feel sick, but I can't say anything because she was kind enough to make them for me. I don't know what it is about finding hair in food but it makes me gag. When she asks how the sandwiches were I'll just say they were great.",/r/firstworldproblems/comments/a88a2g/hair_in_the_sandwich_my_mum_made_me/,1545383843,0
